                          title: '‘It has been a year since I felt joy’: Paul Sagar on coming to terms with the climbing accident that paralysed him'
                          content: '<p>Paul Sagar, 37, is reader in political theory in the department of political economy at King’s College London. He studied at the universities of Cambridge, Oxford and London and in 2020 received the British and Irish Association for Political Thought early career award for excellence in research and teaching. A once passionate rock climber, he suffered a catastrophic accident last year while climbing in Scotland. The accident left him tetraplegic, paralysed from the collarbones down, with only residual use of his hands. After eight months in hospital, he resumed academic work in early 2024, continuing physical rehabilitation and attempting to adjust to life with severe disability. This is an extract from his diary of the past 16 months.</p> <h2><strong>22 August 2023</strong></h2> <p>On 5 June, I was climbing in Glencoe with a friend. Because of friability in the rock, a route we had thought to be in unusually safe condition turned out to be almost lethal. On the final pitch, as I was leading, the rock collapsed and much of my gear exploded out of the placements. I fell about 20 metres. My left arm was shattered severely, and my right arm was also broken, albeit less badly. Worst of all I fractured two vertebrae in my neck.</p> <p>Luckily, I was climbing with a surgeon that day and through amazing good fortune and his incredible skill and composure, he saved my life. I was airlifted to Glasgow hospital where I had several operations and awoke four weeks later. After a period of drug-induced insanity I eventually came to something like my senses. Since then, I have been transferred to the Royal London hospital, where I am undergoing the start of a very long physio journey.</p> <p>At present, I have limited use of my hands and no control of my body below my abdominal muscles. This is not exactly how I planned to spend my summer, to say the least.</p> <p>I have written this short post using voice dictation software, partly just to prove to myself that I can. The likelihood is I will never walk again, let alone climb.</p> <h2><strong>1 September</strong></h2> <p>If I had to pick the single worst thing about living in hospital, there would be some stiff competition. There is the constant disruption, having no control over when I wake up, with people barging into the room at whatever time suits them to jab me with needles or slam bin lids. There is the total dependency on others to complete the most mundane of tasks, be it feeding myself or getting my teeth brushed. There is the infuriating frequency with which staff will talk about me when I’m in the room, or ask each other questions that I know the answers to, but which they do not bother to consult me about because the default assumption is that the patient is clueless.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>I want to be an able-bodied man with his life back. The fact this is impossible doesn’t stop me wanting it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, the number one worst thing about being an early stage spinal injury patient in hospital is, for me at least, the daily humiliation. You see, an aspect of spinal injury I wasn’t aware of until it happened to me is that it’s not just that you lose the ability to use your legs and possibly your hands . You also lose functional control of your bowels and bladder. </p> <p>Hence this week I underwent a minor surgery to drill a tube directly into my bladder, making my penis effectively redundant. I have anyway by now lost count of the number of strangers who have either seen or had to wash my genitals.</p>    <h2><strong>11 September</strong></h2> <p>Who am I? It’s hard to be sure any more. In recent days I have found it harder and harder to shake the feeling that I am an impostor. Increasingly I am struck with the sense that somebody did die that day in early June. I share his name, his legal details, his date of birth, and even his memories. Other people seem to think that I am him. But I am increasingly unsure. I look at the arms attached to me now, and they are thin like twigs. Forearms have disappeared completely, while biceps are a rump of what once was. When I have glanced at my chest during occasions of being washed, I am astounded to see that it simply no longer exists. There is just flat bone above visible ribs. When attempting to do the most basic of exercises, a mind that remembers developing serious core strength over years tries to engage abdominal muscles that cannot perform even the beginning of a single measly sit-up. And then, of course, there are the hands that barely function and the legs that do not move at all. The person who woke up on 5 June looked and felt absolutely nothing like this.</p> <p>Somebody died that day, and somebody different survived. I am the survivor, playing the role once held by a dead man, and every day slightly puzzled as to why nobody seems to have noticed the switch.</p> <h2><strong>1 October</strong></h2> <p><em>I am now in the </em><em>rehab department</em><em> at the </em><em>Royal National Orthopaedic hospital</em><em> at </em><em>Stanmore, Middlesex</em><em>.</em></p> <p>Conversation matters. It distracts me from my situation and connects me to a world beyond my circular thoughts. But it’s also risky. Topics that ought to be safe are, for me, not necessarily so.</p> <p>Take the weather. Comments on the unseasonable warmth we’re having are tough for me to hear. Yes, it means I can visit the rehab centre gardens. On the other hand, I immediately think of how I’m not out climbing in such perfect weekend conditions. And never will be again.</p> <p>Many remarks can trigger pain without the other person meaning to, or even realising. Take the friendly Irish nurse who tonight told me of her love of hiking in the Peak District, her trips to the Lake District, her walks in Switzerland. It took all my strength not to reply <em>you have no fucking idea</em>. <em>I didn’t just hike those places. I saw and accessed sights you can’t even imagine</em>. And then my mind is flooded with all the places I’ll never see again. The North London Mountaineering Club hut in Snowdonia, my home from home that I planned to visit regularly until I died. Wen Zawn at Gogarth. My favourite Kalymnos bar. Portland sport routes. The Borrowdale trad crags. The view of Italy from 3,000m. The feeling of slinging a full rucksack back into the van after a long day’s effort. Wyoming. El Chorro. Fontainebleau. Never again. And the list goes on.</p> <p>It might sound strange but the emotion I feel in relation to this is heartbreak. I realised this today after a kind nursing assistant asked me (respectfully, in appropriate circumstances) what my accident had been. I told her the story. And then I began to cry. A 36-year-old man in tears, in front of a near stranger.</p> <h2><strong>5 October</strong></h2> <p>The truth is I’m finding rehab very hard. After spending nearly three months fixating on getting here, the reality of starting intensive physio and therapy is not the instant salvation I had hoped it would be.</p> <p>The rehab team gave me a power wheelchair this week, which restores a modicum of independence. All I can think about, however, is how small the rehab centre is, having now lapped it dozens of times. And about how winter will soon make even the gardens inaccessible. And this is where I will spend every day for months. The other night we were lucky enough to listen to music performed live in the large outdoor pod. Upbeat songs about love and joy? They just make me think about how I don’t have a partner, I don’t have children, and I’ve realistically blown any chance at either from here on out. So what is left to give the fight meaning? What’s the point?</p>    <h2><strong>19 October</strong></h2> <p>I am no longer the only published author among the patients at rehab. Indeed, I’m not even close to being the most widely read any more. That’s because a couple of weeks ago <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/12/my-body-is-broken-but-im-not-going-to-give-up-hanif-kureishi-on-life-after-the-accident-that-paralysed-him">Hanif Kureishi</a> arrived to also undergo rehabilitation. As well as being a successful novelist and screenwriter, Hanif directly inspired me to start these blogs. That’s because he has been dictating Substack posts via his partner and children since he suffered a debilitating spinal cord injury himself on Boxing Day last year. I was made aware of his regular “dispatches” while in Royal London hospital, and read all of them. It was helpful to hear what somebody else going through the same kind of experience as me was making of it, and it brought me solace when he wrote about struggling with some of the same things that I have. More generally it made me think that if he could write, then I should try writing too. And so I did.</p> <p>Hanif and I have had a couple of good conversations since he arrived, but nothing is ever easy in this new life and he is now mostly isolated for infection control reasons.</p> <h2><strong>3 December</strong></h2> <p>I’ve written before about how utterly overwhelming this experience is. Well it turns out that it doesn’t get easier with time. I didn’t realise one could be overwhelmed by constantly feeling overwhelmed. Overwhelm fatigue. Metawhelmed, if you like. That’s where I’m at right now. My mind is a cacophony of paradoxical, or at least incoherent, thoughts.</p> <p>Here’s an example. Last week was my “case conference”, when the therapists and medical leads here sat down with my parents and I to discuss my progress to date, and future steps. They congratulated me on having made real gains as a result of trying very hard in my various physio and therapy sessions, and therefore extending my admission by another month. This is only done for people who have made progress and whom it is believed will make further gains if they stay longer. By no means does everyone get extended.</p> <p>Great news for me, right? Of course I can see that this is ultimately positive. My parents were a little baffled, however, as to why I nonetheless apparently took so little cheer from it. The answer is that I find it hard to be uplifted by progress towards a goal that I fundamentally don’t want. The brute truth is that I don’t want to be a better-than-expected tetraplegic. I want to be an able-bodied man with his life back. And the fact this is impossible doesn’t stop me wanting it. </p> <h2><strong>26 January 2024</strong></h2> <p>If nothing else, the past half a year has made me acutely aware of how dependent on family one becomes even while living in the heart of the NHS. If it weren’t for my mother and father, I would be truly screwed. It would have been impossible for me to single-handedly deal with things like securing accommodation for the future, let alone communicating with my employer and various crucial organisations during the first few months of my injury. As far as I can tell, after an accident like mine, those who don’t have family to pick up the pieces are in the direst of dire&nbsp;straits.</p> <p>So I’m lucky to have parents who care enough, and are competent enough and financially stable enough, to offer me serious help in rebuilding something like a life. And for this, of course, I am grateful. Which leads to a question: why then do I sometimes behave like such a shit?</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>The most painful thing is sorting old clothes. Every item had a connection to my former life and put a dagger through my heart</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Last weekend was not my finest hour. Having made the long trek down from Merseyside to the rehab centre just outside Watford, my mum and dad came to spend time with me. And I rewarded them with toddler levels of truculence and incivility. Why can’t I behave nicely, as a fitting display of the gratitude that I do genuinely feel towards them?</p> <p>The answer I think lies, at least in part, in the fact that half a year ago I was an independent adult with his own income, career, projects, and so forth, but I am now effectively reduced to the status of a child. I need Mummy and Daddy to help me with everything in life. And this is a very difficult thing to come to terms with. And if one is now living like a baby, why not act like one?</p> <p>Add to that the fact that I’m now in the position of having to be grateful <em>all the time</em>: to the person that wipes my arse, to whoever washes me, or puts my clothes on or brushes my teeth. I am grateful to the person that brings my lunch out and puts it in front of me, to the nurse who puts my afternoon medication into my mouth. I am grateful to the staff in the gym that I spend most of the day with, most of whom by now have had to cope with either my piss or shit at least once. I am grateful to whichever persons put me to bed before propping up my iPad so that I can watch some crap on Netflix before falling asleep and repeating it all again.</p> <p>The result of this is what one might call gratitude exhaustion. </p> <h2><strong>5 February</strong></h2> <p>One of the many things that I never appreciated about my old life is that I was virtually never bored. My work consisted mostly of reading and discussing interesting ideas with colleagues and students. If I got bored during the day, I’d amuse myself by playing online chess (poorly). I trained for climbing 10 to 15 hours a week, while weekends were almost always spent driving somewhere it wasn’t raining so as to climb outdoors.</p> <p>Evenings after training left time for good-quality TV, or reading a novel. And of course there were always friends to catch up with in London if I ever felt like actually being sociable. Failing that, I’d go fishing. Essentially, if I was awake I was active, either in body or mind. A lazy weekend, doing nothing, was something like my idea of a bad time.</p> <p>The contrast with my new life could hardly be more stark. I now regularly spend chunks of time just doing nothing. </p> <p>The strangest thing, though, is how accustomed I have become to this mode of living. Seconds become minutes, become hours, become days. Time just drifts by unfilled, and I watch as it passes. I’m bored, but weirdly indifferent about that boredom. It doesn’t drive me crazy like it would have before. I’ve become somebody else; somebody I don’t especially admire, but who seems worryingly like they are here to stay.</p> <h2><strong>10 March</strong></h2> <p>I have now moved on to a nursing home. There is no doubt that it is an improvement on living behind a curtain in a hospital ward. Nonetheless, I have the sense of starring in my own personal <em>Groundhog</em> <em>Day</em>. Every day is basically the same. Mornings are lost, waiting for my various needs to be dealt with. Afternoons I spend trying to work, with decreasing levels of enthusiasm. Evenings I play some online chess, wondering how it is possible to get progressively worse as the days pass. Then it is back to bed for yet more TV. Rinse, repeat. I never go anywhere new. I have no plans. There are no holidays to look forward to. No weekends away. Just more of the same, day after day. Bill Murray, I get it now.</p> <p>And so it might not be especially surprising to hear that I am not doing very well psychologically. Leaving the hell of rehab, getting some minimal privacy, and being able to read serious work for the first time in months gave me an initial mental boost. But it is not especially surprising that this was not a magic cure. And yet I am still taken aback by the scale of my mental collapse. I feel as hopeless, as unable to accept and adapt, as at any other time since I regained consciousness. For a few weeks, I genuinely thought I was getting better. I do not feel even remotely close to that any more.</p>    <p>All of which has led me to a decision. I have begun the process of formally applying to Dignitas, with the eventual possibility of assisted suicide. Many more steps will be required if I am ultimately to go through with this, and I will have the option of changing my mind at many points in the future. (Some people have tried to tell me that I will not be eligible because I am not terminally ill, but I have done my research and although there is no guarantee that I will be accepted for consideration, tetraplegics from Britain have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/27/the-britons-who-made-their-final-journey-to-dignitas-clinic">used the Swiss service before</a>.) At the very least, what this gives me is the psychological comfort of knowing there is an escape route. I am so tired of feeling completely trapped, forced to stay alive by other people, with all the power and control removed from my own life. Even if I don’t take the option, knowing that the option is at least there provides a kind of comfort: the knowledge that I still have a final small amount of meaningful agency, that I can finally make this <em>stop</em> if I want to.</p> <h2><strong>11 May</strong></h2> <p>Last week I completed the long process of losing my home. The apartment I lived in for three years has changed hands, and now belongs to somebody else. And it hurts so much.</p> <p>The place was very modest; just a small one-bedroom flat. But it was <em>mine</em>. Those were my bookshelves. My choices of mountainscape on the wall. My arrangement of furniture. My base of operations for work, whenever I wasn’t travelling, trying to get as much time in the great outdoors as I could. Shortly before my accident, as a way of channelling the emotional pain from the breakup of a four-year relationship I had repainted most of the walls and doors, even had a new carpet fitted in the bedroom. And then one day I walked out and drove away, not knowing that it was for the last time. Nobody told me that I would never see the place again. I never got to say goodbye.</p> <h2><strong>5 June</strong></h2> <p>It has been a year to the day since my accident. A year since I woke up somewhere peaceful, somewhere quiet, at a time of my own choosing. Since it was up to me alone how long I stayed in bed. A year since I could piss standing up, of my own volition, rather than it dribbling out of me into a plastic bag. A year since I made my own breakfast. Since I was able to lift a normal cup of coffee. A year since I was able to drive, often hundreds of miles at a time, just to be outdoors and in the wild.</p> <p>Far more than a year since I held a woman’s hand, felt the touch of a human body against mine. But a year since these things were even possible for me; something that could sanely be hoped for some future day. A year since it was physically possible for me to enjoy exercise, or use it as a weapon against the parasite of depression that now resides in regal ascendancy over my mind. A year since I climbed. That indescribable world of adventure, which gave my life satisfaction and meaning. The antidote to the psychological ill-health that an academic career made me otherwise so especially vulnerable to.</p> <p>A year since I woke up even just indifferent about, let alone looking forward to, the day ahead. A year since my first thought hasn’t been wishing that I had died in the night. A year since I felt more than fleeting moments of happiness. A year since I felt joy.</p> <p>A year since I died.</p> <p>A year since I was reborn into a life I never agreed to, and would never have chosen, but am condemned by others to continue. A lot can change in a year. And so perhaps, out of the darkness, comes also the light of hope.</p> <h2><strong>18 June</strong></h2> <p>Through the herculean efforts of my parents, I now have a new place to call my own. And making the adjustment has been perhaps the most difficult thing I have been through so far.</p> <p>I really didn’t think it would be this way. While nervous, before the date of the move I experienced a definite uptick in mood. This began to fade once we pulled on to the North Circular. Here was a route I had driven many times in my old life. The store where I bought furniture for my first apartment. The pet shop where I sometimes got supplies for the cats (that I no longer have). The turning I used to take to the Lea Valley to fish for pike in the winter. When I last saw these places, I was driving my own van. Now I was in the back of an ambulance, being awkwardly jolted around. Memories came flooding back punching me in the gut, reminding me how much I have lost.</p> <p>My mum came down to meet the ambulance crew and help transfer me and my possessions up into the new flat.</p> <p>One thing stopping this apartment from feeling like a home is that the walls are all bare. The answer to which would normally be obvious and easy: hang up my own pictures. But there’s the rub. Hanging any of my old artwork on the walls is almost too painful to contemplate, not least because a lot of it consists of framed pictures of mountains. Mountains <em>that</em> <em>I</em> <em>have</em> <em>climbed</em>. Even non-climbing artwork inevitably comes with memories of previous homes it has hung in; past times in my past life; friends in happier years.</p> <p>But pictures were by no means the worst of it. Also transported from my old home to my new were my old clothes. The problem is that now I can’t wear most of them. All of my old jeans, and anything with a button or a buckle, now poses the threat of pressure sores. When it comes to upper layers, anything snug against my former physique is now impossible to combine with the repulsive potbelly I permanently sport. So I agreed to help my mum triage my old clothes, deciding what to keep and what to throw away.</p> <p>I don’t think I’m exaggerating when I say this is the most painful thing I’ve ever had to do. Virtually every piece of clothing had some connection to my former life: climbing gear, bouldering gym merch, T-shirts from climbing destinations, outdoor brands – aside from the odd Guns N’ Roses T-shirt, almost every item put a dagger through my heart. Or rather, two daggers. One for myself, who died. One for climbing, the love I lost.</p> <h2><strong>7 August</strong></h2> <p>It’s been a while, and enough people have been in contact in various ways, asking if I’m all right, that I feel a quick update is in order. In the grand scheme of things, yes. On the physical side, putting aside for now that my body is a wreckage site that will only get worse with time, I’m doing OK. No further complications, with UTIs and spasms under control, for once.</p> <p>On the mental side, well… it’s a process. My occupational therapist in rehab told me that most people find the first three to six months after leaving hospital the hardest. My physical therapist said I should expect the first year to be “hell”. So far, I can’t argue with that. I’ve been able to distract myself with academic research and writing, which is certainly more than nothing. But it’s hard to feel like it’s enough.</p>    <h2><strong>25 October</strong></h2> <p>I have been watching the debate over changing the UK’s law on assisted dying with sardonic interest. On the face of it the debate should have nothing to do with me. I, after all, am not terminally ill, and what is being debated is whether people with six months or less to live should be able to die by suicide with medical help. I simply don’t meet the criteria. However, those who oppose a change in the law often claim that if the law is loosened, we will be on a slippery slope down to a place where <em>people</em> <em>like</em> <em>me </em>(disabled people) are not only offered assisted suicide, but pressed by wider society into taking that option. And as this would be bad, the law should stay as it is. On the other side, those who favour changing the law vigorously deny (at least in public) that any such slippery slope will be encountered – and thus they implicitly or explicitly agree that assisted suicide should only be for those who, to put it bluntly, are going to die soon anyway. Hence, again, it is <em>not</em> <em>for me. </em>The effect of which is to compound my overwhelming sense that I am trapped in a living nightmare from which I cannot escape.</p> <p>When medical professionals decided that my ruined body should live, whether I might have wanted it to or not, they also determined that any future choice about whether to continue would for ever be taken away from me. Whereas a normal-bodied (or even just less disabled) person could take matters into their own hands and decide that enough is enough, I cannot. I need the help of someone else. And the law is pretty clear that nobody is allowed to help me. Hence, trapped. The potential loophole here is of course to go abroad, to a jurisdiction where medically assisted suicide is legal. And so, I’m working on it. The application to Dignitas is active.</p> <h2><strong>11 November</strong></h2> <p>In ancient Greek mythology, Pandora is said to have unleashed a range of curses upon humankind. Curiosity led her to open a box entrusted to her husband, out of which death, sickness and a host of other evils escaped. But left behind, so the story goes, was hope.</p> <p>One way to read this is as a sort of consolation. That despite all the evils humanity is forced to endure, we are able to cling to the light of hope. But I’ve long suspected (both before my accident, and especially since) that hope is the worst curse of them all.</p> <p>Moral philosophers like Adam Smith would rightly point out that being in a wheelchair, with virtually useless hands, is not a permanent obstacle to mental tranquillity. Plenty of happy tetraplegics prove it to be so (and indeed, I have met some of them). If I first <em>accept</em> my situation, and allow my psychology to adjust to it, it should be possible to escape the pit of despair.</p> <p>But I am consumed by a hope that holds me back. This comes in the form of longing for medical and technological advances that somehow “cure” spinal cord injury. This is indulged by regular Google searches along those lines. Like the other night, when I went down the rabbit hole of investigating NVG-291, the leading candidate for a therapeutic treatment, now in <a href="https://nervgen.com/cto/">phase 1b/2a human trials</a>. Riding the high of hope, I convince myself that I’m only going to have to do this for a few years, and then I’m going to get my life back. But then the hope wears off, and reality hits: that even if it lives up to the most optimistic hopes, NVG-291 is only going to restore partial functions, and will anyway take years to arrive in a clinically administered setting. And even if it does arrive, I am not getting my old life back, because that life is now definitively over.</p> <p>As the saying goes, it’s the hope that kills you. My hope is a curse. I need it to die. I need to accept.</p> <p>Maybe tomorrow.</p> <ul> <li><p>Read Paul Sagar’s Substack, Diary of a Punter, <a href="https://diaryofapunter.substack.com/">here</a></p></li> </ul>'

                          title: 'The Church of England is beset by shame and division. Can it survive?'
                          content: '<p>The resignation last week of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/12/justin-welby-why-archbishop-chosen-for-his-managerial-skills-had-to-go">archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby</a>, has raised far-­reaching questions among clergy and observers about the future of the Church of England.</p> <p>“This is a crisis moment for the church,” says <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gilesfraser">Giles Fraser, an Anglican priest</a> and media theologian. “I think it’s a turning point.”</p> <p>“There needs to be a complete reset as to how this whole organisation is run at the top,” says <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/11/former-oxford-college-dean-and-senior-cleric-to-leave-church-of-england">Martyn Percy, former dean of Christ Church</a>, University of Oxford. “We need a statutory independent inquiry.”</p> <p>These reactions follow the publication of the long-delayed Makin review on how the church handled the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/11/the-guardian-view-on-abuse-and-the-church-of-england-a-reckoning-is-due-for-a-shameful-failure">allegations of sexual abuse by John Smyth</a>, a man who was an early influence on Welby. Makin made clear Welby was one of the people who had displayed a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/13/justin-welby-archbishop-resignation-church-of-england">distinct lack of curiosity</a>” about the “most prolific serial abuser to be associated with the Church of England”.</p> <p>The former chair of the Iwerne Trust – a conservative charity that ran evangelical camps where Welby was once a dormitory officer – Smyth is thought to have groomed and savagely beaten <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/13/highly-likely-john-smyth-continued-to-abuse-young-men-in-south-africa">as many as 130 boys and young men</a> in three countries across five decades. Eight boys received a total of 14,000 lashes, and two more suffered 8,000 between&nbsp;them.</p> <p>He started his sado-sexual campaign in the 1970s and by 1982, after one of his victims attempted suicide, the trust and a number of church members were aware of the allegations against him. In a familiar out-of-sight, out-of-mind move, funds were raised to send Smyth to Zimbabwe in 1984, where he would later be charged with the manslaughter of a 16-year-old boy – he was never convicted of the offence, it is thought because of his powerful connections within the Zimbabwean government.</p> <p>However appalling the Smyth case is, there is a danger whenever assessing the Church of England of crying wolf, simply because it is <em>always</em> in crisis. After all, it has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/24/church-of-england-declining-congregations-councils">losing its congregation</a> for ­decades, is stuck in an existential battle between its liberal and evangelical wings, and struggles to hold together a global communion of 85&nbsp;million Anglicans.</p> <p>Defenders of the church, including Welby himself, have pointed out that Smyth was not a clergyman and his vicious assaults on boys from Winchester College, where he took part in the school’s Christian Union, were outside the church’s jurisdiction.</p> <p>Ian Paul, an associate ­minister and member of the General Synod who writes an ­evangelical blog, <em>Psephizo</em>, says there is no comparison with the plight of the Catholic church in Ireland, where religious influence has dramatically waned after a succession of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/29/catholic-church-still-failing-to-deal-with-sexual-abuse-cases-says-vatican-report">sex and abuse scandals</a> involving priests and nuns.</p> <p>“This is not about abuse within the Church of England,” he says. “Smyth was not a minister of the Church of England.”</p> <p>This is true, but he was a lay reader who served at Christ Church Winchester, and an active part of the laity, so any attempt to distance Smyth from the church looks more like an act of self-protection than one of communal moral responsibility. And it’s not a good look for an institution that prides itself on its high ethics and benevolence to say about a monstrous abuser operating in its midst: “Nothing to do with us, guv.”</p> <p>Nonetheless, Paul does not dismiss the unprecedented significance of Welby’s resignation.</p> <p>“In 1621,” he says, “the incumbent archbishop of Canterbury actually killed somebody with a bow and arrow on a hunting trip, and even then <em>he</em> didn’t resign.”</p> <p>So something major is afoot: it’s just that the clergy can’t agree on what it is. For Paul, Welby represented an anything-goes liberalism that stood in contradiction to church doctrine, and was a poor leader. “Justin managed to make ­enemies of every single group. He made ­enemies of liberals by talking about evangelism. He made enemies of evangelicals by talking about ­sexuality. He made enemies of conservatives by talking about new forms of church.”</p> <p>The kind of change Paul would like to see – a return to established and more conservative doctrine – will be hampered, he says,&nbsp;by the bishops that Welby appointed during his 12-year tenure.</p> <p>“It’s been widely observed that the bench of bishops we now have is the weakest we’ve ever had in the history of the church,” he says. “Justin himself tried to get Paula Vennells [the disgraced former head of the Post Office] <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/feb/22/justin-welby-church-should-have-asked-more-questions-about-ex-post-office-boss">shortlisted for bishop</a> of London. That is absolutely&nbsp;catastrophic.”</p> <p>Percy, an academic specialising in ecclesiology who has been an outspoken critic of the hierarchy’s failure to listen to survivors of abuse within the church, agrees that the problem lies at the top but sees it as primarily a lack of transparency and accountability, exemplified by the issue of safeguarding.</p> <p>“It’s another serious rupture in the reservoir of trust. People just look at the church and say or intuit that this is not an institution they can trust – and it’s very hard to get that trust back,” he says.</p> <p>He describes Lambeth Palace as a self-preserving bureaucracy riven by intrigue, “including secretive organisations”, and intent on obfuscation and damage limitation.</p> <p>“I don’t think they have any perception that their secrecy and their lack of accountability, their lack of transparency and external scrutiny, is 100% the problem,” he says.</p> <p>He maintains that Smyth was not an isolated case. In 2016, he says he met a group of survivors in Oxford who told him “utterly harrowing” ­stories of abuse by figures within the church.</p> <p>The perpetrators, he says, were made known to the authorities but remained in the church and were subsequently promoted. “They’ve suffered absolutely no penalty whatsoever,” he says.</p> <p>Yet at the same time, he argues, the safeguarding measures that Welby oversaw are ill-thought-out and arbitrarily enforced, and deter the sort of volunteers on whom the church has traditionally relied for local good works.</p>    <p>Percy’s remedy is for the church to open itself up to independent assessment and break up its top-heavy bureaucracy. One aspect of this reform, he says, would be disestablishment from the British state. Ever since Henry VIII’s Act of Supremacy in 1534, the church has been part of the English and, later, British state, with the monarch as the supreme governor and ­ecclesiastical representation in the House of Lords.</p> <p> “What they need to do is get themselves back down to ground level and work out what it means to be a national church which is not an established church,” says&nbsp;Percy.</p> <p>It sounds like the continuation of the Protestant revolution that was never quite completed in the 16th century, when elements of the&nbsp;Catholic system of hierarchy were absorbed into the newly formed church.</p> <p>On balance, Fraser is against disestablishment, but he agrees that the church should scale back its global operations and focus more on the parish level.</p> <p>“Why did Welby miss all of this? It wasn’t that he was malevolent but that he was so overstretched. And there’s an ego thing going on here. They prefer to get out of the airport in Kigali with 3,000 people waving flags rather than spending a rainy afternoon in Stockport with survivors shouting at him. Who wouldn’t? But actually that’s what they’ve got to do.”</p> <p>Fraser would like to see the bishop of Chelmsford, Guli Francis-Dehqani – the “one outstanding candidate” – appointed archbishop of Canterbury, not least, he says, “because women are going to be more trusted on safeguarding than&nbsp;men”.</p> <p>While nobody expects that Welby’s resignation will arrest the long-term decline in church attendance, Paul argues that Britain is a less secular nation than is often believed. “There will be more Christians in church on a Sunday morning than people attending football matches at every level from schools up to professional,” he says.</p> <p>But a diminishing number of them are in Church of England ministries. How much this has to do with a country losing its religion, and how much it is a reflection of the church’s shrinking sociocultural relevance, is open to debate.</p> <p>What does seem clear, though, is that the church finds it hard to establish a coherent message because so much of its doctrinal teaching is subject to internal and international dispute. Nor is it adept at capitalising on wider social movements, partly for that reason.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/11/the-guardian-view-on-abuse-and-the-church-of-england-a-reckoning-is-due-for-a-shameful-failure">The Guardian view on abuse and the Church of England: a reckoning is due for a shameful failure | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One example is the rise in some quarters of what’s called “cultural Christianity”, a sort of secular appreciation of the religion’s active legacy, as well as the rituals and traditions that accompany it.</p> <p>Some critics suggest it is a movement born of anxiety about the cultural changes wrought by mass immigration, and in particular the rise of Islam.

So we need to make sure that we are sharing stories that are relevant to wider society,” she said.</p> <p>The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) declined to say whether the prime minister and officials would endorse Peek’s chain of beacons, fish supper and hymn plans. Earlier this summer, Rishi Sunak supported Peek’s efforts to mark D-day’s 80th anniversary.</p> <p>A DCMS spokesperson said: “The 80th anniversaries of VE and VJ Days will be moments of huge significance for our country, and the government is committed to commemorating the occasions appropriately. That is why we have announced more than £10m for events. </p> <p>“We will announce the government’s plans to mark the occasion shortly.”</p> <p>Peek, who plans to retire after next year’s events, has often worked independently of government at previous national celebrations but is unimpressed. “This is why I get frustrated,” he said. “There are too many egos getting in the way.”</p> <p>“I’ve got all the parish, borough, and district councils working with me – the heartbeat of their local communities,” he said.</p> <p>He hopes that a boy and a girl, both aged eight to reflect the eight decades that have passed, will light the main beacon at the London Eye and added that his plans also reflect a multicultural Britain. “That hymn is one anyone who is proud of their country – any country – can sing, whatever their race, creed or colour,” he said.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Royal British Legion said: “I think we really need to be clear about what our plans are before we decide to work in partnership with anyone.”</p>'

                          title: 'Trump converts voters in deep-blue California – was it all about the economy?'
                          content: '<p>Donald Trump on 5 November expanded his coalition across the United States, and he did so even in deep-blue California.</p> <p>While Kamala Harris unsurprisingly beat out Trump in the Golden State – receiving about 60% of the vote – the former president nonetheless pulled off a victory, winning eight counties that supported Joe Biden in 2020.</p> <p>It may take years to fully understand the dynamics that contributed to the shift, but experts and political observers have so far pointed to the economy and diminished voter enthusiasm as key elements.</p> <p>Notorious for taking weeks to fully tally the election results, California is still finishing up its count. With more than 1m ballots left to sort through, the results could change, but as of Friday evening, Trump appears to have flipped eight counties from voting Democrat to Republican in the presidential race: Butte, Merced, Stanislaus, Fresno, San Joaquin, Inyo, San Bernardino and Riverside.</p> <p>The counties are concentrated in the state’s interior, from the Inland Empire east of Los Angeles to the agricultural heartland in the Central Valley. They’re generally more rural and not as progressive as population centers on the coast, and several are closely split between the parties while others are predominantly Democratic. Half of the counties backed a mix of Democrats and Republicans in US House races while one – Merced – supported a Democrat in its sole House contest.</p> <p>More than 1 million people voted for Trump in those areas, which are home to almost 7 million people.</p> <p>Polling by the <a href="https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/california/?r=0">Associated Press</a> and Norc at the University of Chicago suggest that California voters saw the economy as the most important issue facing the country, ahead of immigration, the climate and abortion access.</p> <p>It’s a trend seen across the country, said Mark Baldassare, the survey director at the Public Policy Institute of California, with voters<strong> </strong>feeling negatively about the economy and angry and dissatisfied at those currently in power. </p> <p>Like in other parts of the US, Trump appears to have been able to win over a larger share of young and Latino voters than he did before – although advocacy groups <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/trump-latino-support-polls-hispanic-vote-2024-election-rcna179932">disagree</a> about precisely how significant his gains were. In California, a decisive majority of Latino voters cast their ballots for Harris. Still, Trump managed to increase his share of the vote in most Latino-majority counties in California, according to <a href="https://calmatters.org/politics/elections/2024/11/california-election-latino-voters-trump/">CalMatters</a>, including Fresno and Riverside.</p> <p>Perceptions of the economy played a major role in the shift, organizers have said. “The most potent driver in the election was economic discontent, expressed in president-elect Donald Trump’s gains with most demographics,” Clarissa Martínez de Castro, the UnidosUS vice-president of the Latino Vote Initiative, said in a <a href="https://unidosus.org/press-releases/hispanic-voters-back-harris-over-trump-by-a-62-37-margin-cite-economic-concerns-as-top-priorities/">statement</a>, while emphasizing that most Latino voters backed Harris.</p> <p>Meanwhile, it appears turnout in California dropped from 2020, particularly among those who vote infrequently, said Baldassare.</p> <p>“That suggests that the more infrequent voters probably didn’t make it [and] didn’t feel motivated as they did in 2020, which of course was during the pandemic and a time of considerable political angst,” he said.</p> <p>Low-propensity voters that did make it to the polls may have been more motivated by the economy, Baldassare added.</p> <p>“That meant some people were voting for change in large enough numbers,” he said.</p> <p>Lisa Pruitt, a rural law expert at the University of California, Davis, said the results suggest some Californians believe the state’s policies have ventured too far left. Along with Trump’s gains, the state’s voters backed a measure to enact <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/05/california-prop-36-results">harsher penalties</a> for theft and drug offenses, and rejected an effort to ban <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/11/california-prop-6-fails">forced labor</a> in prisons. Progressive district attorneys in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/01/la-district-attorney-george-gascon-candidates-election">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/oakland-mayor-sheng-thao">Oakland</a> lost their seats.</p>    <p>“I think a lot of Californians think the state has moved too far to the left on crime, on so-called law and order – issues. And they are seeking a correction,” she said, adding that trans rights has also become a wedge issue for some voters.</p> <p>A state law banning school districts from requiring parental notification if a child makes changes to their gender identification has attracted fierce <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/17/gavin-newsom-lawsuit-gender-identity-law">backlash</a> in conservative parts of the state and drawn <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/02/california-town-rightwing-battle-schools-lgbtq">national attention</a>.</p> <p>“California is a bellwether of progressive politics and we are seeing a recoiling from that in our own state,” Pruitt said.</p> <p>But Trump’s victory in the US more broadly is part of a pattern that can be seen across the world, said James Adams, a political science professor at the University of California, Davis. Governing parties across the west, from Portugal to Finland to Germany are being voted out, and populist candidates are gaining support, Adams said.</p> <p>“The Republican party under Donald Trump is essentially a populist party with the message that the system is rigged and serves the interest of the rich and powerful and ignores ordinary people,” he said. “That message is one that seems to resonate across western democracies.”</p> <p>High inflation has eroded support for governing parties and confidence in their abilities to manage the economy, he added.</p> <p>Far northern California’s Butte county, which is evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, went to Trump. In Chico, the largest city in the county, however, voters supported Harris at similar levels they did Biden in 2020 and progressives were close to gaining a majority on the city council not seen in years.</p> <p>Addison Winslow, a progressive on Chico’s city council, attributes Trump’s gains to the Democratic party failing to acknowledge the economic realities for voters and put forward a candidate who people trust.</p> <p>“The anecdotal info I get is not that people are more conservative or more racist now or more hostile to progressive policies, but [that] the Democratic party has failed to put forward any national figures that the public trusts,” said Winslow.</p> <p>“What the Democrats have done is say, ‘Inflation isn’t that bad any more, the economy is actually really good,’” he said. “Maybe they can pull some economic indicators and say, ‘Look, I’m right’ but that just hasn’t been the personal experience of people.”</p>'

                          title: 'New Orleans’ elusive Scrim the dog once again on the lam after daring escape'
                          content: '<p>There are escape artists, and then there is the elusive dog from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-orleans">New Orleans</a> known as Scrim.</p> <p>A local pet-adoption service owner rescued the terrier from a dog pound where he faced the possibility of euthanasia – but Scrim then fled the home of a family that adopted him and spent about six months on the run before an elaborate effort to capture him succeeded in October, according to media outlets, including <a href="https://www.nola.com/entertainment_life/scrim-escaped-dog-first-day-captivity-new-orleans/article_d823d94e-924e-11ef-9e7c-7fa2077d8f08.html">Nola.com</a>.</p> <p>More than one social media user in the Big Easy joked that Scrim was “for the streets” rather than domesticity – and it now appears that may not have been a mere witticism. On Friday morning, Scrim busted through a second-floor window at the house where he was recovering from injuries incurred during his first escape, jumped about 13ft to the ground and again made a dash for freedom, the home’s owner, Michelle Cheramie, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCb9oyHRnuT/">wrote</a> on Saturday on her Zeus’ Rescues Instagram account.</p> <p>“Trust me when I say that there is nothing negative that you can say to me or about him getting loose again that I haven’t already said to myself in the last 24 hours,” read Cheramie’s post, which contained stunning home security camera video of Scrim plunging to the ground, sprinting through a wrought-iron fence and vanishing from view.</p> <p>Scrim had run more than two miles (3.2km) when the battery on his GPS collar died, once again leaving Cheramie and those who have helped her look for him with no clue to his precise whereabouts.</p> <p>Reuniting with Scrim during his first stint on the lam was no small feat.</p> <p>After Cheramie saved him from the dog pound, a family in New Orleans’ Mid-City neighborhood eventually adopted him. But Scrim quickly escaped and earned a measure of social media stardom as users posted videos from cellphones and security cameras whenever he was spotted jaunting through the streets.</p> <p>Those searching for him were equipped with traps, nets and tranquilizer guns, but he frustrated their efforts until Cheramie got a call the night of 23 October that Scrim had been sighted.</p> <p>Cheramie soon posted on social media: “WE GOT HIM!!!!”</p> <p>Scrim did not emerge from that run unscathed. He was missing a chunk out of his ear and had suffered various abrasions while X-rays revealed two projectiles – possibly small bullets or air rifle pellets – were lodged inside his little body, according to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/dog-captured-scrim-new-orleans-houdini-7575c851f790d2e01622c4f7a440415c">Associated Press</a>, citing information a veterinarian who examined Scrim told New Orleans media outlets.</p> <p>He and Cheramie ventured out on 7 November to the chambers of New Orleans’ city council, where civic leaders honored Scrim for displaying “resilience”, as one of the body’s members worded it. The plan was for Scrim to stay at Cheramie’s home to recover from his wounds before he was again put up for adoption.</p> <p>Scrim turned that plan on its head when, according to what Cheramie told Nola.com, he chewed through the screen of an open second-story window, squeezed through and leapt out.</p> <p>Cheramie wrote on Instagram that soon her team was distributing flyers and knocking on doors, asking people to keep a lookout for Scrim as a second search for him got under way.</p> <p>“I am not focusing on his escape but focusing all my mental energy on safely capturing him again,” Cheramie’s post said.</p> <p>“It took all of us coming together to find him last time. I am asking for your help again.”</p>'

                          content: '<p><strong>Wolf Hall: The Mirror </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>the Light</strong> (BBC One) | <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0024z1n/wolf-hall-the-mirror-and-the-light-1-wreckage">iPlayer</a><br><strong>Bad Sisters</strong> (<a href="https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/bad-sisters/umc.cmc.14kr4vv65unannh7doqgvlh20">Apple TV+</a>)<br><strong>Immigration: How British Politics Failed</strong> (BBC Two) | <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0024qb1/immigration-how-british-politics-failed-series-1-episode-1">iPlayer</a><br><strong>The Penguin</strong> (<a href="https://www.sky.com/watch/the-penguin">Sky Atlantic</a>/ <a href="https://www.nowtv.com/watch/the-penguin/iYEQZ2rcf32Y5xEUtq4wdY/iYsxVQTYrUBMYhe8hJKH8f/seasons/1">Now</a>)</p> <p>I ’m a huge fan of Hilary Mantel’s double Booker prize-winning <em>Wolf Hall</em> trilogy, and was frustrated and unimpressed by BBC Two’s 2015 dramatisation of the first two novels, <em>Wolf Hall</em> and <em>Bring Up </em><em>the Bodies</em>. Starring Mark Rylance as Henry VIII’s lowborn fixer, Thomas Cromwell, director Peter Kosminsky’s Bafta-winning adaptation felt as sluggish and laboured as Mantel’s writing was vivid and exciting. The series did ignite about two-thirds in, as Anne Boleyn (played with raw magnificence by Claire Foy) succumbed to trumped-up charges of treason, culminating in the unbearable, wind-lashed scenes of her beheading.</p> <p>Almost a decade later we’re plunged back into those terrible final moments in the opening episode of <strong><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0024z1n/wolf-hall-the-mirror-and-the-light-1-wreckage">Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light</a></strong>, based on Mantel’s concluding novel and again directed by Kosminsky and written by Peter Straughan. Here, Anne’s execution is intercut with Henry preparing for marriage to Jane Seymour (Kate Phillips) – the all-time king of toxic masculinity shrugging on weighty regalia and getting his beard trimmed in his latest bid for a legitimate male heir.</p> <p>“Such freshness, such delicacy,” he purrs of his wedding night to a guilt-ridden but carefully impassive Cromwell, who is rewarded by being made Lord Privy Seal. Alone, Cromwell is frequently visited by the ghost of his former master and true significant other, Cardinal Wolsey (Jonathan Pryce), who will soon remind him of Henry’s lethal caprice: “When fortune turns against you, you will feel the lash.”</p> <p>I suppose spoilers don’t count here; history contains all of those. Bar a few stodgy lulls, from the two episodes (of six) I’ve seen, this second series crackles with tension, driving forward the busy plot points: succession, ambition, peril, absolutism, religious turmoil, omnipresent female powerlessness and fear.</p> <p>Cromwell now seems much more akin to the self-possessed but uncompromising attack dog of the books. It also helps enormously to be able to see what’s happening; at times, the first series looked as if it had been filmed inside a candlelit Tudor duvet cover. Cast changes, such as Timothy Spall replacing the late Bernard Hill as the Duke of Norfolk, work well, while Lilit Lesser is dynamite as Catherine of Aragon’s daughter, Lady Mary.</p>    <p>Then there’s Damian Lewis. The role of Henry is tricky: easy to collapse into cosplay caricature. It doesn’t matter (to me, anyway) that the actor doesn’t look as if he reeks of Henry’s regal gout; it matters that he’s impulsive, mercurial, spoiled, shallow and petrifying, whether being applauded at masked balls by lickspittles or silkily glaring at Cromwell as, finally, the blacksmith’s son blunders into a huge mistake. Lewis is outstanding throughout.</p> <p>I was concerned about the second series of the jet-black comedy <strong><a href="https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/bad-sisters/umc.cmc.14kr4vv65unannh7doqgvlh20">Bad Sisters</a></strong> (Apple TV+). Could it be as compelling without Claes Bang as swaggering smoothie baddie John Paul, who was – spoiler klaxon – offed, after many demented attempts by the bickering Garvey sisters, trying to protect their sibling (his wife) Grace (Anne-Marie Duff). While the original <em>Bad Sisters</em> – adapted by Sharon Horgan, Dave Finkel and Brett Bauer from the Flemish series <em>Clan</em> – was meant as a standalone story, in season two, Horgan creates a new mystery and also writes some episodes.</p> <p>Early blissful scenes of Grace emerging, butterfly-like, from long-term abuse to marry new love Ian (Owen McDonnell) soon give way to the discovery of a corpse, chaos, desperation, police questioning, terrible tragedy and more for her sisters – played by Horgan (bossy Eva, who has a “menopause coach”), Eve Hewson (chaotic Becka, who performs a “nervous wee”), Eva Birthistle (perma-stressed medic Ursula) and Sarah Greene (foxy, eyepatch-sporting Bibi).</p>    <p>The plot becomes a little mangled, and while there are funny lines (“I love incense: it’s how I imagine Jesus smelled”), there are fewer than in the first series. That said, the ensemble playing remains pitch-perfect, and sweetly desperate neighbour Roger (Michael Smiley) is given a malevolent nosy churchwoman sister, Angelica, played with witchy naughtiness by Fiona Shaw. Yes, the suave horror of John Paul is missed, but over the course of eight episodes there’s still much to savour.</p> <p>New two-part BBC Two docuseries <strong><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0024qb1/immigration-how-british-politics-failed-series-1-episode-1">Immigration: How British Politics Failed</a></strong> is to be commended for tackling such a difficult subject, but it also proves the impossibility of having a coherent, intelligent national debate on the matter.</p> <p>Winding back to the early 00s, it’s interesting. Tony Blair talks about the migrant argument for economic growth. There’s an in-depth breakdown of major decisions and mistakes. There’s also a broad range of interviewees, including Andrew Green, whose Migration Watch thinktank produced data and analysis that David Cameron says proved “helpful” to the Conservatives.</p> <p>Unfortunately, every so often Nigel Farage bursts in, doing his Brexit panto routine. Early on he blares: “At least Tony Blair was honest. He said: We’re going to open the doors to the whole world.” (Yawn! Blair didn’t say that.) In next week’s episode, Farage says with ill-disguised relish: “Just you watch, this issue is going to get bigger and bigger.”</p> <p>Is his rather predictable input needed in all such documentaries? Couldn’t there just be a blank screen saying: “Please insert your own Nigel Farage bit here”? I’m not suggesting banning him (perish the thought!) – just giving him a wee rest on the topic of immigration. We can all agree he’s earned it.</p> <p>On Sky Atlantic, Lauren LeFranc’s <strong><a href="https://www.sky.com/watch/the-penguin">The Penguin</a></strong>, an eight-part TV-spin-off from 2022 film <em>The Batman</em>, concluded with the visceral virtuosity that, despite occasional slides into cheesy franchisedom, has made this the year’s most unexpected triumph. I won’t disclose the jaw-dropping and devastating late twist. I can reveal (lesser spoiler alert) that in the closing seconds, a bat logo appears in the sky above Gotham.</p>    <p>One of <em>The Penguin</em>’s secrets has been its committed story arc: it didn’t act like it had umpteen series to make a point. Nor was Oswald “Penguin” Cobb (Colin Farrell)<strong> </strong>played as a joke, but as an intimidating mobster, a charismatic leader, who wears his ugliness on the inside yet still has some to spare on the outside. Farrell’s achievement is that you forget he’s larded in a veritable acreage of prosthetics. You just remember his performance, and it’s staggering.</p> <p><em>Star ratings (out of five)<br>Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light</em> <strong>★★★★</strong><br><em>Bad Sisters</em> <strong>★★★★</strong><br><em>Immigration: How British Politics Failed</em> <strong>★★★</strong><br><em>The Penguin</em> <strong>★★★★</strong></p> <h2>What else I’m watching</h2> <p><strong><a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81685880">Sprint</a><br></strong>(Netflix)<br>The return of the fascinating fly-on-the-wall documentary about international sprinters – among them the irrepressible US champion Noah Lyles.

                          title: 'Cock review: love lies bleeding in Mike Bartlett’s bitter romantic triangle'
                          content: '<p>How charged and potent words can be. And how they can mislead. The title of British playwright Mike Bartlett’s 2009 play is principally a reference to the cockfights he saw in Mexico. But this bait-and-switch is merely the starting gun of a play about the slipperiness of language and labels: gay, straight, boyfriend, brother. Their elasticity is strained and snapped.</p> <p>It’s a tension that buzzes through this new production – the first time the play has been seen in the north of England. Joe Gill plays John, the only named character, who confesses to his boyfriend, M, at the start to cheating on him with a woman, W. The play rolls through the fallout, rewinds to John’s first encounter with W, then culminates in them all meeting for a prickly dinner.</p> <p><em>Cock</em> – first staged in 2009 – dates from Bartlett’s early career, before he turned to political subjects such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/13/charles-iii-birdland-small-family-business-review">King Charles III</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/17/the-great-middlemarch-mystery-coventry-review-the-47th-mike-bartlett-bertie-carvel-old-vic-for-black-boys-who-have-considered-suicide-when-the-hue-gets-too-heavy-ryan-calais-cameron-royal-court">Donald Trump</a>. But it was a time when sexual fluidity was less examined – and accepted – than today, and the drama hangs on an obligation to define your sexuality that feels a little dated.</p> <p>Director Rupert Hill confidently controls the bombast of Bartlett’s script, with its elaborate metaphors and narrated sex scene, so it lands less like engineered provocation. Gill’s John, described as “fudge”, droops and sags like a marionette awaiting a puppeteer. John O’Neill’s M glowers, his frenzied agitation suggesting insecurity about John from the start. Hannah Ellis Ryan is poised and needle-like as the disruptor. If they overgesticulate, the effect is of characters grasping for fixed points and physical connection.</p> <p>The volleying and jockeying plays out on a chalked rectangle resembling a sports court, audience on either side of the traverse stage. The characters hurl insults at each other like darts, often leaning forward and finishing with the jab of a finger. This is love and lust as blood sport.</p> <p><em>• <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/cock-by-mike-bartlett-tickets-995072026217">Cock</a></em><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/cock-by-mike-bartlett-tickets-995072026217"> is at 53two, Manchester, until 17 November</a></p>'

                          content: '<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/kemi-badenoch">Kemi Badenoch</a>’s second go at prime minister’s questions last Wednesday was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/13/kemi-badenoch-is-her-own-worst-enemy-and-a-gift-to-keir-starmer-and-labour-pmqs">judged a flop</a> at Westminster but she did draw attention to one genuine issue: the impact of the national insurance rise for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/social-care">social care</a>.</p> <p>It is 14 years since the Tories sank Andy Burnham’s plan for a “death tax” to fund social care. Over that time, as demand has continued to rise, there have been patches and sticking plasters, including the social care precept, and the decision to fill gaping holes in the workforce with a surge in overseas workers.</p> <p>But the basic picture, of overstretched staff, under-resourced councils, and families (including mine) juggling the emotional distress of a declining relative with the costs of ensuring that they are well looked after, has only worsened.</p> <p>And so we find ourselves in 2024, with councils wondering how they can meet the costs of April’s tax increases. (Scotland and Wales take different approaches but many of the underlying pressures are similar.)</p> <p>Eagle-eyed experts spotted a revealing late correction to official budget forecasts last week.</p> <p>As Andrew Harrop, a former chair of the Fabian Society, pointed out, the Office for Budget Responsibility had initially assumed the Treasury would compensate the sector for the costs of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/national-insurance">national insurance</a> contributions (NICs) rise but later corrected itself.</p> <p>The difference between the two published figures revealed that the OBR expects the employer NICs rise alone to cost social care employers £800m. That more than swallows up the £600m extra that Rachel Reeves promised the sector in the budget, and which Keir Starmer shot back at Badenoch.</p> <p>Add in the (welcome) chunky rise in the “national living wage” in April, and workforce costs are likely to rise by more than £1bn. Harrop issued a warning: “If extra money is not found to compensate for the tax rise the consequences will be dire.” </p> <p>This uncertainty is just the latest indication of social care’s neglected status. Short-term crunches such as these will keep recurring until politicians have the courage to agree a more sustainable funding model.</p> <p>Social care reform is a live issue at the top of government, with Starmer expected to take the final decision about whether to hold a royal commission, or an internal government review. Such a review seems unlikely to unearth new solutions – though perhaps, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/24/social-care-review-may-work-this-time-realistic-plan">as my colleague Polly Toynbee</a> argues, it could help to make the argument for unpalatable ones.</p> <p>Meanwhile, though, Angela Rayner and Wes Streeting are pressing ahead with a quietly radical plan that could yet be the key to prising open the problem. The pair convened a meeting earlier this month at which employers, unions and local authorities began discussions about negotiating minimum standards for pay and conditions in social care, which the government would then enforce across the sector in England, by law.</p> <p>This idea, of a “fair pay agreement”, was part of the Make Work Pay agenda in Labour’s manifesto. It is ambitious: there are an estimated 18,500 care providers, ranging from individual homes run as small businesses, to big chains backed by private equity, via a whole ecosystem of charities. Even establishing who should sit around the table is a challenge.</p> <p>While it has been named a fair <em>pay</em> agreement, it could potentially be a vehicle for progress on other aspects of care workers’ lives, such as shift patterns and allowance for travel time.</p> <p>Career progression is another issue. Staff with five years’ experience earn just 10p an hour more than new starters.</p> <p>One relevant model is the vast Agenda for Change bargaining unit, which covers more than a million workers across the health service. But unlike there, the taxpayer does not foot the entire bill for social care: an estimated 37% of residents in care homes are self-funded, for example. That makes ministers’ role more ambiguous.</p> <p>Also unlike the NHS, union density in the social care sector is relatively low. Unions, including Unison and the GMB, hope that representing workers in a formal arrangement like this will be a powerful recruiting tool – but at the outset there will be questions of legitimacy on both sides of the table.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Rayner and Streeting’s engagement is a clear signal that the government is serious.</p> <p>It might seem topsy-turvy to begin here – before we can say how any uplift be paid for. Yet perhaps the working conditions at the coalface of care are a more humane starting point for policy than the drive to cap consumers’ costs.</p> <p>Even more so than for many other public services, social care <em>is</em> its workforce. Having modern, purpose-built infrastructure is helpful; new tech might save time in rota management; but, ultimately, care is made up of myriad human interactions.</p> <p>Improving productivity – and quality – is likely to require a better-motivated workforce that does not have to be constantly recruited and trained as staff flee for better-paid alternatives.</p> <p>Turnover was more than 25% in 2023-24; in other words, more than one in four care workers changed job. About one in 10 leaves the sector altogether each year.</p> <p>The workforce development body, Skills for Care, reckons that the UK <a href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/Adult-Social-Care-Workforce-Data/Workforce-intelligence/publications/national-information/The-size-and-structure-of-the-adult-social-care-sector-and-workforce-in-England.aspx">will need more than half a million additional care workers</a> by 2040 to cope with rising need in an ageing society. There is no route to achieving that without raising the pay and status of caring as a profession. And it’s a feminist issue: almost 80% of care workers are women.</p> <p>It will not be cheap: Skills for Care calculates that lifting hourly pay to £1 above the minimum wage, and allowing for better progression, would cost taxpayers £2bn a year – though the government’s <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/671259d59cd657734653d7e5/impact-assessment-establish-a-fair-pay-agreements-process-in-the-adult-social-care-sector.pdf">impact assessment</a> estimates that the treasury would get 40p of every £1 back in increased taxes and lower benefit payments.</p> <p>Putting a floor under pay and conditions would also help to ensure that additional funding finds its way to the workforce instead of seeping out in profits.</p> <p>Clearly, terms and conditions for social care workers cannot be divorced from the pressing need to ensure significantly more money flows into this sector, not just in the short-term but sustainably.</p> <p>But opening up a conversation with the 1.6 million people doing this vital job, often on poverty pay, seems as good a way as any of understanding the shape of the challenge for social care, and what could be won if we crack it.</p>'

                          title: 'Mystery surrounds 800-year-old Leicester burial pit containing 123 bodies'
                          content: '<p>In gardens a few metres from Leicester Cathedral, archaeologists have made a disturbing discovery. Their excavations have revealed a narrow vertical shaft filled with the remains of 123 men, women and children.</p> <p>It is one of the largest pit burials ever excavated in the UK, with subsequent research suggesting the bodies were dumped there more than 800 years ago, early in the 12th century.</p> <p>However, the reasons for putting the corpses in this tiny, ancient shaft remain a mystery.</p> <p>“Their bones show no signs of violence – which leaves us with two alternative reasons for these deaths: starvation or pestilence,” said Mathew Morris, project officer at Leicester University’s archaeological services. “At the moment, the latter is our main working hypothesis.”</p> <p>The excavations by Morris and his colleagues suggest the bodies were put into the shaft in three deposits, in rapid succession. “It looks as if successive cartloads of bodies were brought to the shaft and then dropped into it, one load on top of another in a very short space of time,” he said. “In terms of numbers, the people put in there probably represented about 5% of the town’s population.”</p> <p>The discovery of the mass burial provides a vivid insight into life in England more than eight centuries ago, said Morris. “Other pit burials have been found in the region but this is the biggest. Actually, just trying to find comparable pit burials anywhere in the country is proving really hard.”</p> <p>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles repeatedly mention great pestilences and fevers, severe mortality, and miserable deaths from hunger and famine in England from the mid-10th century through to the mid-12th century, said Morris. “This mass burial fits within this timeframe and provides physical proof of what was then occurring across the nation.”</p>    <p>The discovery of the mass burial is the result of a decision to build a new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/22/richard-iii-visitor-centre-leicester">heritage learning centre</a> at the cathedral. Twelve years ago, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/24/richard-iii-leicester-car-park-steve-coogan-philippa-langley-lost-king">body of Richard III </a>was found underneath a nearby car park and was subsequently buried in the cathedral, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-67090903#:~:text=%C2%A312.7m.-,The%20cathedral%20said%20visitor%20numbers%20had%20increased%20ten%2Dfold%20since,made%20the%20work%20more%20urgent.">triggering a tenfold rise in visitor numbers</a>. To cope with this influx, a new centre supported by the National Lottery Heritage Fund was approved for construction in the cathedral’s garden, a former burial ground, after a full archaeological survey had been carried out.</p> <p>This has now been completed by Morris and his colleagues. In the garden, they uncovered the remains of 1,237 men, women and children, ranging from those buried in the 19th century, down to those who were interred in the early 11th century.</p> <p>“It’s a continuous sequence of 850 years of burials from a single population from a single place, and you don’t get that very often,” added Morris. “It has generated an enormous amount of archaeology.”</p>    <p>Below these burials, the team found evidence of Anglo-Saxon dwellings and, further beneath, a Roman shrine. But most striking of all was the small vertical burial shaft that was discovered at one side of the dig: the pit burial containing the remains of 123 individuals.</p> <p>At first, the team assumed these people had died during the Black Death, the outbreak of bubonic plague that struck England in 1348 and which is thought to have killed between a third and a half of the population.</p> <p>“We initially thought this was going to be the first evidence of the Black Death arriving in Leicester,” said Morris. Then the team got the results of radiocarbon dating tests of bones from the pit. These showed that the bodies had been dumped there almost 150 years earlier, around the beginning of the 12th century.</p> <p>“That was surprising,” Morris admitted. “We have no idea, at present, what might have triggered such a massive cause of death. As far as we know, the bubonic plague did not reach our shores until 1348. So what was the cause of the mass deaths that occurred then?”</p>    <p>To find answers to this question, the Leicester team has sent samples from the bodies in the pit to geneticists at the Francis Crick Institute in London in order to search for viruses, bacteria or parasites that might have triggered the blight that struck Leicester.</p> <p>“It was clearly a devastating outbreak that resonates with recent events, in particular the Covid pandemic,” said Morris. “But it is also important to note there was still some form of civic control going on. There was still someone going around in a cart collecting bodies. What we see from studying the bodies in the pit does not indicate it was created in a&nbsp;panic.”</p> <p>He added: “There was also no evidence of clothing on any of the bodies – no buckles, brooches, nothing to suggest these were people who were dropping dead in the street before being collected and dumped.</p> <p>“In fact, there are signs that their limbs were still together, which suggests they were wrapped in shrouds. So their families were able to prepare these bodies for burial before someone from a central authority collected them to take to the pit burial.”</p>'

                          title: 'To turn Britain around, we need a proper understanding of life for poorer workers | Torsten Bell'
                          content: '<p>Things have not being going well for low- and middle-income Britain: wages flatlining, public services crumbling and, as a result, faith in mainstream politics eroding. To start turning things around, it pays to understand the country as it exists today, not as it once was or as you imagine it to be.</p> <p>So, we should all pay attention to “Unsung Britain”, a major research project from my old Resolution Foundation colleagues, which aims to provide an audit of the circumstances and challenges of the poorer half of the working-age population. <a href="https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/unsung-britain/">Their launch report</a> already has important lessons.</p> <p>First, improving health and wealth are not separate objectives. Those on low-to-middle incomes are more than five times more likely than richer people to be out of work because of ill health. When critics say the budget’s extra money for the NHS does nothing for growth, they are missing the point.</p> <p>Second, poorer Britain <em>is</em> working. Yes, recent rising ill health has reduced employment, but the long view is that employment among low-to-middle income families is up nine percentage points since the mid-90s. There has been no rise among richer households. Contrary to many headlines, the share of poorer families in which no one is working has near halved since Tony Blair came to power (from 24% to 13%). Today, we need to improve the pay, security and volatility of people’s work.</p> <p>Third, the feeling of being squeezed is real. Half of low-to-middle income families’ spending went on essentials (like food and housing) at the start of the century. Now? In part due to higher housing costs, essentials eat up £3 out of every £5. We need to build, build, build. Our social contract hasn’t delivered for millions. It’s time to understand our country, so we can change it. </p> <p>• Torsten Bell is Labour MP for Swansea West and author of <em>Great Britain? How We Get Our Future Back</em></p>'

                          title: 'Pink fishy goo makes bad news palatable | David Mitchell'
                          content: '<p>Have you ever asked yourself a question along the lines of: “If you had to choose not to eat bread or not to eat potatoes, what would you go for?”, or perhaps: “If you had to either never ever have a starter or never ever have a pudding, which would you pick?” You probably have. Maybe not while alone, but as part of some desultory group chat. Though perhaps you rise above it – these are very hypothetical scenarios, after all. Who exactly is going to say that forever after you can only have starters or puddings? Donald Trump? It doesn’t strike me as his style. Keir Starmer might float the idea since he’s so worried about the NHS, but then he’d pub-garden it within 48 hours. Perhaps you’ll develop type 2 diabetes and have to give up desserts but there won’t be any scope for bargaining. “I simply must have meringue but I’m willing to swear off paté and prawn cocktails in exchange” is not an argument any reputable doctor will accept.</p> <p>It’s diverting, though, in a bland way. If you’re at all interested in yourself, and it’s probably a mental health red flag if you’re not, you can’t help pondering it a bit. “Ooh, I love a roast potato, but instead of toast? That’s a poser. I think I’d have to keep toast.” That’s a little snippet from my own scintillating interior monologue, by the way. “Starters ahead of puddings. Every day of the week.” And there’s another. Like thinking about what you’d do if you ruled the world or won the lottery, it provokes harmless little explorations of what you’re like. “Do you know, I wouldn’t actually want it to be Christmas every day because then it wouldn’t be a treat,” you can proudly announce to yourself and any of the others in the chat. And hopefully there’s no rise-abover who’ll say: “Remind me, are we mortal or immortal, we humans? It’s mortal, isn’t it. We’re mortal. So what the hell is this?!”</p> <p>These little thought experiments were brought to mind by reports of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/12/shoppers-bemoan-uk-taramasalata-shortage-as-strike-leads-to-dip-in-supply">UK’s current severe shortage of taramasalata</a>. You can probably guess the cause. Yes, it’s industrial action in Spalding, as you suspected. As a result, most supermarkets are denuded of all tubs of pink fishy goo. If you’re ranking dips (which you really might get on to after deciding you’d definitely illegalise split-toe trainers and go for both an indoor and an outdoor pool because why not), you might say that taramasalata is your favourite. I mean, you might. But it’s surely got to be Pepsi to hummus’s Coke, right? – if that comparison works despite Pepsi and Coke, unlike taramasalata and hummus, being near identical. In this analogy, I reckon tzatziki would maybe be Fanta, but obviously without the Nazi origin story.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>Limoncello is a regrettable liquid and only marginally preferable to dying of thirst</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some people have been really thrown by it, with one X user saying her family had been forced into sourcing their taramasalata from restaurants. I suppose there was nothing else they could have done. I must say I find this a rather relaxing shortage. In a universe where I would give up potatoes if I could continue to have toast, what would I give up to continue to have taramasalata? Not much. Not crisps, for example. Not even crinkle-cut crisps. Maybe one packet of crisps – although I’m not sure. Three crisps. I would forgo three crisps to keep taramasalata in my life. And I don’t dislike it. It’s fine.</p> <p>Limoncello! I would swap limoncello for taramasalata. I certainly wouldn’t mix them – except under circumstances where I’d accidentally ingested poison and a stomach pump was unavailable. But, yes, I don’t mind never having limoncello if I can still have taramasalata. And that sentence remains true without the phrase “if I can still have taramasalata”. Limoncello is a regrettable liquid – I mean, it’s barely a liquid, it makes Benylin seem runny – and only marginally preferable to dying of thirst.</p> <p>Still, shortages can be unsettling. They bring back memories of early Covid and the spectre of a British public racked with disease and unable even to wipe our own bottoms. But compared with the likes of loo roll, flour, pasta and paracetamol, taramasalata is vanilla – and indeed might be substituted with vanilla if you’ve put it on any forthcoming Ocado orders.</p> <p>Like shortages, supermarket deliveries were something many of us first encountered because of Covid. We experienced first the terror of being unable to go and buy food, then the magic of it just turning up without having to – though this miracle was soon obscured by the fog of annoyance at their bizarre substitutions. Who decides this? A very stupid human or a third-rate algorithm? I wanted cranberry sauce not ketchup! What were they thinking? Jesus Christ, they’ve substituted celeriac for parsnips, a poussin for a turkey, a joke plastic dog turd for a Tesco Finest Cumberland ring and low-fat mayonnaise for mayonnaise! I <em>hate</em> low-fat mayonnaise!</p> <p>The most severe shortage at the moment is of course good news. Everything feels a bit bleak; hot on the heels of a British election that seemed like cause for hope of a more civilised and benevolent few years comes an American one that promises only riots, bullshit, a confidence boost for the Ku Klux Klan and a warm embrace of climate catastrophe.</p> <p>Strictly speaking, this taramasalata situation is more bad news. There’s an industrial dispute going on between members of the trade union Unite and their employer Bakkavor at its Spalding processing plant. Unite says its members have received below inflation pay rises for years, Bakkavor sees it otherwise. This row will be no metaphorical picnic for the people involved and, as a result, the literal picnics of the nation have been jeopardised.</p> <p>Yet, in the absence of anything genuinely positive, a substitution must be made. We need to manufacture ersatz good news and, for me, that’s what the taramasalata shortage is. It’s very stressful for several hundred people and mildly irritating for millions but, looked at in context, it is so much less bad than the coverage surrounding it, that it actively looks nice, like the seeming brightness of a dark grey shape on a pitch black background.</p>'

As of now, some areas remain without power, but all necessary forces are working to mitigate the consequences and restore the infrastructure.</p> <p>We am grateful to all our air defense units that participated in repelling this attack: anti-aircraft missile forces, our aviation – pilots of F16s, Su aircraft, and MiGs, mobile fire groups, and electronic warfare units – all worked together in an organized and coordinated manner. I thank them for their reliable protection.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div>'

                            title: '‘It has been a year since I felt joy’: Paul Sagar on coming to terms with the climbing accident that paralysed him'
                            content: '<p>Paul Sagar, 37, is reader in political theory in the department of political economy at King’s College London. He studied at the universities of Cambridge, Oxford and London and in 2020 received the British and Irish Association for Political Thought early career award for excellence in research and teaching. A once passionate rock climber, he suffered a catastrophic accident last year while climbing in Scotland. The accident left him tetraplegic, paralysed from the collarbones down, with only residual use of his hands. After eight months in hospital, he resumed academic work in early 2024, continuing physical rehabilitation and attempting to adjust to life with severe disability. This is an extract from his diary of the past 16 months.</p> <h2><strong>22 August 2023</strong></h2> <p>On 5 June, I was climbing in Glencoe with a friend. Because of friability in the rock, a route we had thought to be in unusually safe condition turned out to be almost lethal. On the final pitch, as I was leading, the rock collapsed and much of my gear exploded out of the placements. I fell about 20 metres. My left arm was shattered severely, and my right arm was also broken, albeit less badly. Worst of all I fractured two vertebrae in my neck.</p> <p>Luckily, I was climbing with a surgeon that day and through amazing good fortune and his incredible skill and composure, he saved my life. I was airlifted to Glasgow hospital where I had several operations and awoke four weeks later. After a period of drug-induced insanity I eventually came to something like my senses. Since then, I have been transferred to the Royal London hospital, where I am undergoing the start of a very long physio journey.</p> <p>At present, I have limited use of my hands and no control of my body below my abdominal muscles. This is not exactly how I planned to spend my summer, to say the least.</p> <p>I have written this short post using voice dictation software, partly just to prove to myself that I can. The likelihood is I will never walk again, let alone climb.</p> <h2><strong>1 September</strong></h2> <p>If I had to pick the single worst thing about living in hospital, there would be some stiff competition. There is the constant disruption, having no control over when I wake up, with people barging into the room at whatever time suits them to jab me with needles or slam bin lids. There is the total dependency on others to complete the most mundane of tasks, be it feeding myself or getting my teeth brushed. There is the infuriating frequency with which staff will talk about me when I’m in the room, or ask each other questions that I know the answers to, but which they do not bother to consult me about because the default assumption is that the patient is clueless.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>I want to be an able-bodied man with his life back. The fact this is impossible doesn’t stop me wanting it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, the number one worst thing about being an early stage spinal injury patient in hospital is, for me at least, the daily humiliation. You see, an aspect of spinal injury I wasn’t aware of until it happened to me is that it’s not just that you lose the ability to use your legs and possibly your hands . You also lose functional control of your bowels and bladder. </p> <p>Hence this week I underwent a minor surgery to drill a tube directly into my bladder, making my penis effectively redundant. I have anyway by now lost count of the number of strangers who have either seen or had to wash my genitals.</p>    <h2><strong>11 September</strong></h2> <p>Who am I? It’s hard to be sure any more. In recent days I have found it harder and harder to shake the feeling that I am an impostor. Increasingly I am struck with the sense that somebody did die that day in early June. I share his name, his legal details, his date of birth, and even his memories. Other people seem to think that I am him. But I am increasingly unsure. I look at the arms attached to me now, and they are thin like twigs. Forearms have disappeared completely, while biceps are a rump of what once was. When I have glanced at my chest during occasions of being washed, I am astounded to see that it simply no longer exists. There is just flat bone above visible ribs. When attempting to do the most basic of exercises, a mind that remembers developing serious core strength over years tries to engage abdominal muscles that cannot perform even the beginning of a single measly sit-up. And then, of course, there are the hands that barely function and the legs that do not move at all. The person who woke up on 5 June looked and felt absolutely nothing like this.</p> <p>Somebody died that day, and somebody different survived. I am the survivor, playing the role once held by a dead man, and every day slightly puzzled as to why nobody seems to have noticed the switch.</p> <h2><strong>1 October</strong></h2> <p><em>I am now in the </em><em>rehab department</em><em> at the </em><em>Royal National Orthopaedic hospital</em><em> at </em><em>Stanmore, Middlesex</em><em>.</em></p> <p>Conversation matters. It distracts me from my situation and connects me to a world beyond my circular thoughts. But it’s also risky. Topics that ought to be safe are, for me, not necessarily so.</p> <p>Take the weather. Comments on the unseasonable warmth we’re having are tough for me to hear. Yes, it means I can visit the rehab centre gardens. On the other hand, I immediately think of how I’m not out climbing in such perfect weekend conditions. And never will be again.</p> <p>Many remarks can trigger pain without the other person meaning to, or even realising. Take the friendly Irish nurse who tonight told me of her love of hiking in the Peak District, her trips to the Lake District, her walks in Switzerland. It took all my strength not to reply <em>you have no fucking idea</em>. <em>I didn’t just hike those places. I saw and accessed sights you can’t even imagine</em>. And then my mind is flooded with all the places I’ll never see again. The North London Mountaineering Club hut in Snowdonia, my home from home that I planned to visit regularly until I died. Wen Zawn at Gogarth. My favourite Kalymnos bar. Portland sport routes. The Borrowdale trad crags. The view of Italy from 3,000m. The feeling of slinging a full rucksack back into the van after a long day’s effort. Wyoming. El Chorro. Fontainebleau. Never again. And the list goes on.</p> <p>It might sound strange but the emotion I feel in relation to this is heartbreak. I realised this today after a kind nursing assistant asked me (respectfully, in appropriate circumstances) what my accident had been. I told her the story. And then I began to cry. A 36-year-old man in tears, in front of a near stranger.</p> <h2><strong>5 October</strong></h2> <p>The truth is I’m finding rehab very hard. After spending nearly three months fixating on getting here, the reality of starting intensive physio and therapy is not the instant salvation I had hoped it would be.</p> <p>The rehab team gave me a power wheelchair this week, which restores a modicum of independence. All I can think about, however, is how small the rehab centre is, having now lapped it dozens of times. And about how winter will soon make even the gardens inaccessible. And this is where I will spend every day for months. The other night we were lucky enough to listen to music performed live in the large outdoor pod. Upbeat songs about love and joy? They just make me think about how I don’t have a partner, I don’t have children, and I’ve realistically blown any chance at either from here on out. So what is left to give the fight meaning? What’s the point?</p>    <h2><strong>19 October</strong></h2> <p>I am no longer the only published author among the patients at rehab. Indeed, I’m not even close to being the most widely read any more. That’s because a couple of weeks ago <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/12/my-body-is-broken-but-im-not-going-to-give-up-hanif-kureishi-on-life-after-the-accident-that-paralysed-him">Hanif Kureishi</a> arrived to also undergo rehabilitation. As well as being a successful novelist and screenwriter, Hanif directly inspired me to start these blogs. That’s because he has been dictating Substack posts via his partner and children since he suffered a debilitating spinal cord injury himself on Boxing Day last year. I was made aware of his regular “dispatches” while in Royal London hospital, and read all of them. It was helpful to hear what somebody else going through the same kind of experience as me was making of it, and it brought me solace when he wrote about struggling with some of the same things that I have. More generally it made me think that if he could write, then I should try writing too. And so I did.</p> <p>Hanif and I have had a couple of good conversations since he arrived, but nothing is ever easy in this new life and he is now mostly isolated for infection control reasons.</p> <h2><strong>3 December</strong></h2> <p>I’ve written before about how utterly overwhelming this experience is. Well it turns out that it doesn’t get easier with time. I didn’t realise one could be overwhelmed by constantly feeling overwhelmed. Overwhelm fatigue. Metawhelmed, if you like. That’s where I’m at right now. My mind is a cacophony of paradoxical, or at least incoherent, thoughts.</p> <p>Here’s an example. Last week was my “case conference”, when the therapists and medical leads here sat down with my parents and I to discuss my progress to date, and future steps. They congratulated me on having made real gains as a result of trying very hard in my various physio and therapy sessions, and therefore extending my admission by another month. This is only done for people who have made progress and whom it is believed will make further gains if they stay longer. By no means does everyone get extended.</p> <p>Great news for me, right? Of course I can see that this is ultimately positive. My parents were a little baffled, however, as to why I nonetheless apparently took so little cheer from it. The answer is that I find it hard to be uplifted by progress towards a goal that I fundamentally don’t want. The brute truth is that I don’t want to be a better-than-expected tetraplegic. I want to be an able-bodied man with his life back. And the fact this is impossible doesn’t stop me wanting it. </p> <h2><strong>26 January 2024</strong></h2> <p>If nothing else, the past half a year has made me acutely aware of how dependent on family one becomes even while living in the heart of the NHS. If it weren’t for my mother and father, I would be truly screwed. It would have been impossible for me to single-handedly deal with things like securing accommodation for the future, let alone communicating with my employer and various crucial organisations during the first few months of my injury. As far as I can tell, after an accident like mine, those who don’t have family to pick up the pieces are in the direst of dire&nbsp;straits.</p> <p>So I’m lucky to have parents who care enough, and are competent enough and financially stable enough, to offer me serious help in rebuilding something like a life. And for this, of course, I am grateful. Which leads to a question: why then do I sometimes behave like such a shit?</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>The most painful thing is sorting old clothes. Every item had a connection to my former life and put a dagger through my heart</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Last weekend was not my finest hour. Having made the long trek down from Merseyside to the rehab centre just outside Watford, my mum and dad came to spend time with me. And I rewarded them with toddler levels of truculence and incivility. Why can’t I behave nicely, as a fitting display of the gratitude that I do genuinely feel towards them?</p> <p>The answer I think lies, at least in part, in the fact that half a year ago I was an independent adult with his own income, career, projects, and so forth, but I am now effectively reduced to the status of a child. I need Mummy and Daddy to help me with everything in life. And this is a very difficult thing to come to terms with. And if one is now living like a baby, why not act like one?</p> <p>Add to that the fact that I’m now in the position of having to be grateful <em>all the time</em>: to the person that wipes my arse, to whoever washes me, or puts my clothes on or brushes my teeth. I am grateful to the person that brings my lunch out and puts it in front of me, to the nurse who puts my afternoon medication into my mouth. I am grateful to the staff in the gym that I spend most of the day with, most of whom by now have had to cope with either my piss or shit at least once. I am grateful to whichever persons put me to bed before propping up my iPad so that I can watch some crap on Netflix before falling asleep and repeating it all again.</p> <p>The result of this is what one might call gratitude exhaustion. </p> <h2><strong>5 February</strong></h2> <p>One of the many things that I never appreciated about my old life is that I was virtually never bored. My work consisted mostly of reading and discussing interesting ideas with colleagues and students. If I got bored during the day, I’d amuse myself by playing online chess (poorly). I trained for climbing 10 to 15 hours a week, while weekends were almost always spent driving somewhere it wasn’t raining so as to climb outdoors.</p> <p>Evenings after training left time for good-quality TV, or reading a novel. And of course there were always friends to catch up with in London if I ever felt like actually being sociable. Failing that, I’d go fishing. Essentially, if I was awake I was active, either in body or mind. A lazy weekend, doing nothing, was something like my idea of a bad time.</p> <p>The contrast with my new life could hardly be more stark. I now regularly spend chunks of time just doing nothing. </p> <p>The strangest thing, though, is how accustomed I have become to this mode of living. Seconds become minutes, become hours, become days. Time just drifts by unfilled, and I watch as it passes. I’m bored, but weirdly indifferent about that boredom. It doesn’t drive me crazy like it would have before. I’ve become somebody else; somebody I don’t especially admire, but who seems worryingly like they are here to stay.</p> <h2><strong>10 March</strong></h2> <p>I have now moved on to a nursing home. There is no doubt that it is an improvement on living behind a curtain in a hospital ward. Nonetheless, I have the sense of starring in my own personal <em>Groundhog</em> <em>Day</em>. Every day is basically the same. Mornings are lost, waiting for my various needs to be dealt with. Afternoons I spend trying to work, with decreasing levels of enthusiasm. Evenings I play some online chess, wondering how it is possible to get progressively worse as the days pass. Then it is back to bed for yet more TV. Rinse, repeat. I never go anywhere new. I have no plans. There are no holidays to look forward to. No weekends away. Just more of the same, day after day. Bill Murray, I get it now.</p> <p>And so it might not be especially surprising to hear that I am not doing very well psychologically. Leaving the hell of rehab, getting some minimal privacy, and being able to read serious work for the first time in months gave me an initial mental boost. But it is not especially surprising that this was not a magic cure. And yet I am still taken aback by the scale of my mental collapse. I feel as hopeless, as unable to accept and adapt, as at any other time since I regained consciousness. For a few weeks, I genuinely thought I was getting better. I do not feel even remotely close to that any more.</p>    <p>All of which has led me to a decision. I have begun the process of formally applying to Dignitas, with the eventual possibility of assisted suicide. Many more steps will be required if I am ultimately to go through with this, and I will have the option of changing my mind at many points in the future. (Some people have tried to tell me that I will not be eligible because I am not terminally ill, but I have done my research and although there is no guarantee that I will be accepted for consideration, tetraplegics from Britain have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/27/the-britons-who-made-their-final-journey-to-dignitas-clinic">used the Swiss service before</a>.) At the very least, what this gives me is the psychological comfort of knowing there is an escape route. I am so tired of feeling completely trapped, forced to stay alive by other people, with all the power and control removed from my own life. Even if I don’t take the option, knowing that the option is at least there provides a kind of comfort: the knowledge that I still have a final small amount of meaningful agency, that I can finally make this <em>stop</em> if I want to.</p> <h2><strong>11 May</strong></h2> <p>Last week I completed the long process of losing my home. The apartment I lived in for three years has changed hands, and now belongs to somebody else. And it hurts so much.</p> <p>The place was very modest; just a small one-bedroom flat. But it was <em>mine</em>. Those were my bookshelves. My choices of mountainscape on the wall. My arrangement of furniture. My base of operations for work, whenever I wasn’t travelling, trying to get as much time in the great outdoors as I could. Shortly before my accident, as a way of channelling the emotional pain from the breakup of a four-year relationship I had repainted most of the walls and doors, even had a new carpet fitted in the bedroom. And then one day I walked out and drove away, not knowing that it was for the last time. Nobody told me that I would never see the place again. I never got to say goodbye.</p> <h2><strong>5 June</strong></h2> <p>It has been a year to the day since my accident. A year since I woke up somewhere peaceful, somewhere quiet, at a time of my own choosing. Since it was up to me alone how long I stayed in bed. A year since I could piss standing up, of my own volition, rather than it dribbling out of me into a plastic bag. A year since I made my own breakfast. Since I was able to lift a normal cup of coffee. A year since I was able to drive, often hundreds of miles at a time, just to be outdoors and in the wild.</p> <p>Far more than a year since I held a woman’s hand, felt the touch of a human body against mine. But a year since these things were even possible for me; something that could sanely be hoped for some future day. A year since it was physically possible for me to enjoy exercise, or use it as a weapon against the parasite of depression that now resides in regal ascendancy over my mind. A year since I climbed. That indescribable world of adventure, which gave my life satisfaction and meaning. The antidote to the psychological ill-health that an academic career made me otherwise so especially vulnerable to.</p> <p>A year since I woke up even just indifferent about, let alone looking forward to, the day ahead. A year since my first thought hasn’t been wishing that I had died in the night. A year since I felt more than fleeting moments of happiness. A year since I felt joy.</p> <p>A year since I died.</p> <p>A year since I was reborn into a life I never agreed to, and would never have chosen, but am condemned by others to continue. A lot can change in a year. And so perhaps, out of the darkness, comes also the light of hope.</p> <h2><strong>18 June</strong></h2> <p>Through the herculean efforts of my parents, I now have a new place to call my own. And making the adjustment has been perhaps the most difficult thing I have been through so far.</p> <p>I really didn’t think it would be this way. While nervous, before the date of the move I experienced a definite uptick in mood. This began to fade once we pulled on to the North Circular. Here was a route I had driven many times in my old life. The store where I bought furniture for my first apartment. The pet shop where I sometimes got supplies for the cats (that I no longer have). The turning I used to take to the Lea Valley to fish for pike in the winter. When I last saw these places, I was driving my own van. Now I was in the back of an ambulance, being awkwardly jolted around. Memories came flooding back punching me in the gut, reminding me how much I have lost.</p> <p>My mum came down to meet the ambulance crew and help transfer me and my possessions up into the new flat.</p> <p>One thing stopping this apartment from feeling like a home is that the walls are all bare. The answer to which would normally be obvious and easy: hang up my own pictures. But there’s the rub. Hanging any of my old artwork on the walls is almost too painful to contemplate, not least because a lot of it consists of framed pictures of mountains. Mountains <em>that</em> <em>I</em> <em>have</em> <em>climbed</em>. Even non-climbing artwork inevitably comes with memories of previous homes it has hung in; past times in my past life; friends in happier years.</p> <p>But pictures were by no means the worst of it. Also transported from my old home to my new were my old clothes. The problem is that now I can’t wear most of them. All of my old jeans, and anything with a button or a buckle, now poses the threat of pressure sores. When it comes to upper layers, anything snug against my former physique is now impossible to combine with the repulsive potbelly I permanently sport. So I agreed to help my mum triage my old clothes, deciding what to keep and what to throw away.</p> <p>I don’t think I’m exaggerating when I say this is the most painful thing I’ve ever had to do. Virtually every piece of clothing had some connection to my former life: climbing gear, bouldering gym merch, T-shirts from climbing destinations, outdoor brands – aside from the odd Guns N’ Roses T-shirt, almost every item put a dagger through my heart. Or rather, two daggers. One for myself, who died. One for climbing, the love I lost.</p> <h2><strong>7 August</strong></h2> <p>It’s been a while, and enough people have been in contact in various ways, asking if I’m all right, that I feel a quick update is in order. In the grand scheme of things, yes. On the physical side, putting aside for now that my body is a wreckage site that will only get worse with time, I’m doing OK. No further complications, with UTIs and spasms under control, for once.</p> <p>On the mental side, well… it’s a process. My occupational therapist in rehab told me that most people find the first three to six months after leaving hospital the hardest. My physical therapist said I should expect the first year to be “hell”. So far, I can’t argue with that. I’ve been able to distract myself with academic research and writing, which is certainly more than nothing. But it’s hard to feel like it’s enough.</p>    <h2><strong>25 October</strong></h2> <p>I have been watching the debate over changing the UK’s law on assisted dying with sardonic interest. On the face of it the debate should have nothing to do with me. I, after all, am not terminally ill, and what is being debated is whether people with six months or less to live should be able to die by suicide with medical help. I simply don’t meet the criteria. However, those who oppose a change in the law often claim that if the law is loosened, we will be on a slippery slope down to a place where <em>people</em> <em>like</em> <em>me </em>(disabled people) are not only offered assisted suicide, but pressed by wider society into taking that option. And as this would be bad, the law should stay as it is. On the other side, those who favour changing the law vigorously deny (at least in public) that any such slippery slope will be encountered – and thus they implicitly or explicitly agree that assisted suicide should only be for those who, to put it bluntly, are going to die soon anyway. Hence, again, it is <em>not</em> <em>for me. </em>The effect of which is to compound my overwhelming sense that I am trapped in a living nightmare from which I cannot escape.</p> <p>When medical professionals decided that my ruined body should live, whether I might have wanted it to or not, they also determined that any future choice about whether to continue would for ever be taken away from me. Whereas a normal-bodied (or even just less disabled) person could take matters into their own hands and decide that enough is enough, I cannot. I need the help of someone else. And the law is pretty clear that nobody is allowed to help me. Hence, trapped. The potential loophole here is of course to go abroad, to a jurisdiction where medically assisted suicide is legal. And so, I’m working on it. The application to Dignitas is active.</p> <h2><strong>11 November</strong></h2> <p>In ancient Greek mythology, Pandora is said to have unleashed a range of curses upon humankind. Curiosity led her to open a box entrusted to her husband, out of which death, sickness and a host of other evils escaped. But left behind, so the story goes, was hope.</p> <p>One way to read this is as a sort of consolation. That despite all the evils humanity is forced to endure, we are able to cling to the light of hope. But I’ve long suspected (both before my accident, and especially since) that hope is the worst curse of them all.</p> <p>Moral philosophers like Adam Smith would rightly point out that being in a wheelchair, with virtually useless hands, is not a permanent obstacle to mental tranquillity. Plenty of happy tetraplegics prove it to be so (and indeed, I have met some of them). If I first <em>accept</em> my situation, and allow my psychology to adjust to it, it should be possible to escape the pit of despair.</p> <p>But I am consumed by a hope that holds me back. This comes in the form of longing for medical and technological advances that somehow “cure” spinal cord injury. This is indulged by regular Google searches along those lines. Like the other night, when I went down the rabbit hole of investigating NVG-291, the leading candidate for a therapeutic treatment, now in <a href="https://nervgen.com/cto/">phase 1b/2a human trials</a>. Riding the high of hope, I convince myself that I’m only going to have to do this for a few years, and then I’m going to get my life back. But then the hope wears off, and reality hits: that even if it lives up to the most optimistic hopes, NVG-291 is only going to restore partial functions, and will anyway take years to arrive in a clinically administered setting. And even if it does arrive, I am not getting my old life back, because that life is now definitively over.</p> <p>As the saying goes, it’s the hope that kills you. My hope is a curse. I need it to die. I need to accept.</p> <p>Maybe tomorrow.</p> <ul> <li><p>Read Paul Sagar’s Substack, Diary of a Punter, <a href="https://diaryofapunter.substack.com/">here</a></p></li> </ul>'

                            content: '<p>The resignation last week of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/12/justin-welby-why-archbishop-chosen-for-his-managerial-skills-had-to-go">archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby</a>, has raised far-­reaching questions among clergy and observers about the future of the Church of England.</p> <p>“This is a crisis moment for the church,” says <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gilesfraser">Giles Fraser, an Anglican priest</a> and media theologian. “I think it’s a turning point.”</p> <p>“There needs to be a complete reset as to how this whole organisation is run at the top,” says <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/11/former-oxford-college-dean-and-senior-cleric-to-leave-church-of-england">Martyn Percy, former dean of Christ Church</a>, University of Oxford. “We need a statutory independent inquiry.”</p> <p>These reactions follow the publication of the long-delayed Makin review on how the church handled the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/11/the-guardian-view-on-abuse-and-the-church-of-england-a-reckoning-is-due-for-a-shameful-failure">allegations of sexual abuse by John Smyth</a>, a man who was an early influence on Welby. Makin made clear Welby was one of the people who had displayed a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/13/justin-welby-archbishop-resignation-church-of-england">distinct lack of curiosity</a>” about the “most prolific serial abuser to be associated with the Church of England”.</p> <p>The former chair of the Iwerne Trust – a conservative charity that ran evangelical camps where Welby was once a dormitory officer – Smyth is thought to have groomed and savagely beaten <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/13/highly-likely-john-smyth-continued-to-abuse-young-men-in-south-africa">as many as 130 boys and young men</a> in three countries across five decades. Eight boys received a total of 14,000 lashes, and two more suffered 8,000 between&nbsp;them.</p> <p>He started his sado-sexual campaign in the 1970s and by 1982, after one of his victims attempted suicide, the trust and a number of church members were aware of the allegations against him. In a familiar out-of-sight, out-of-mind move, funds were raised to send Smyth to Zimbabwe in 1984, where he would later be charged with the manslaughter of a 16-year-old boy – he was never convicted of the offence, it is thought because of his powerful connections within the Zimbabwean government.</p> <p>However appalling the Smyth case is, there is a danger whenever assessing the Church of England of crying wolf, simply because it is <em>always</em> in crisis. After all, it has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/24/church-of-england-declining-congregations-councils">losing its congregation</a> for ­decades, is stuck in an existential battle between its liberal and evangelical wings, and struggles to hold together a global communion of 85&nbsp;million Anglicans.</p> <p>Defenders of the church, including Welby himself, have pointed out that Smyth was not a clergyman and his vicious assaults on boys from Winchester College, where he took part in the school’s Christian Union, were outside the church’s jurisdiction.</p> <p>Ian Paul, an associate ­minister and member of the General Synod who writes an ­evangelical blog, <em>Psephizo</em>, says there is no comparison with the plight of the Catholic church in Ireland, where religious influence has dramatically waned after a succession of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/29/catholic-church-still-failing-to-deal-with-sexual-abuse-cases-says-vatican-report">sex and abuse scandals</a> involving priests and nuns.</p> <p>“This is not about abuse within the Church of England,” he says. “Smyth was not a minister of the Church of England.”</p> <p>This is true, but he was a lay reader who served at Christ Church Winchester, and an active part of the laity, so any attempt to distance Smyth from the church looks more like an act of self-protection than one of communal moral responsibility. And it’s not a good look for an institution that prides itself on its high ethics and benevolence to say about a monstrous abuser operating in its midst: “Nothing to do with us, guv.”</p> <p>Nonetheless, Paul does not dismiss the unprecedented significance of Welby’s resignation.</p> <p>“In 1621,” he says, “the incumbent archbishop of Canterbury actually killed somebody with a bow and arrow on a hunting trip, and even then <em>he</em> didn’t resign.”</p> <p>So something major is afoot: it’s just that the clergy can’t agree on what it is. For Paul, Welby represented an anything-goes liberalism that stood in contradiction to church doctrine, and was a poor leader. “Justin managed to make ­enemies of every single group. He made ­enemies of liberals by talking about evangelism. He made enemies of evangelicals by talking about ­sexuality. He made enemies of conservatives by talking about new forms of church.”</p> <p>The kind of change Paul would like to see – a return to established and more conservative doctrine – will be hampered, he says,&nbsp;by the bishops that Welby appointed during his 12-year tenure.</p> <p>“It’s been widely observed that the bench of bishops we now have is the weakest we’ve ever had in the history of the church,” he says. “Justin himself tried to get Paula Vennells [the disgraced former head of the Post Office] <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/feb/22/justin-welby-church-should-have-asked-more-questions-about-ex-post-office-boss">shortlisted for bishop</a> of London. That is absolutely&nbsp;catastrophic.”</p> <p>Percy, an academic specialising in ecclesiology who has been an outspoken critic of the hierarchy’s failure to listen to survivors of abuse within the church, agrees that the problem lies at the top but sees it as primarily a lack of transparency and accountability, exemplified by the issue of safeguarding.</p> <p>“It’s another serious rupture in the reservoir of trust. People just look at the church and say or intuit that this is not an institution they can trust – and it’s very hard to get that trust back,” he says.</p> <p>He describes Lambeth Palace as a self-preserving bureaucracy riven by intrigue, “including secretive organisations”, and intent on obfuscation and damage limitation.</p> <p>“I don’t think they have any perception that their secrecy and their lack of accountability, their lack of transparency and external scrutiny, is 100% the problem,” he says.</p> <p>He maintains that Smyth was not an isolated case. In 2016, he says he met a group of survivors in Oxford who told him “utterly harrowing” ­stories of abuse by figures within the church.</p> <p>The perpetrators, he says, were made known to the authorities but remained in the church and were subsequently promoted. “They’ve suffered absolutely no penalty whatsoever,” he says.</p> <p>Yet at the same time, he argues, the safeguarding measures that Welby oversaw are ill-thought-out and arbitrarily enforced, and deter the sort of volunteers on whom the church has traditionally relied for local good works.</p>    <p>Percy’s remedy is for the church to open itself up to independent assessment and break up its top-heavy bureaucracy. One aspect of this reform, he says, would be disestablishment from the British state. Ever since Henry VIII’s Act of Supremacy in 1534, the church has been part of the English and, later, British state, with the monarch as the supreme governor and ­ecclesiastical representation in the House of Lords.</p> <p> “What they need to do is get themselves back down to ground level and work out what it means to be a national church which is not an established church,” says&nbsp;Percy.</p> <p>It sounds like the continuation of the Protestant revolution that was never quite completed in the 16th century, when elements of the&nbsp;Catholic system of hierarchy were absorbed into the newly formed church.</p> <p>On balance, Fraser is against disestablishment, but he agrees that the church should scale back its global operations and focus more on the parish level.</p> <p>“Why did Welby miss all of this? It wasn’t that he was malevolent but that he was so overstretched. And there’s an ego thing going on here. They prefer to get out of the airport in Kigali with 3,000 people waving flags rather than spending a rainy afternoon in Stockport with survivors shouting at him. Who wouldn’t? But actually that’s what they’ve got to do.”</p> <p>Fraser would like to see the bishop of Chelmsford, Guli Francis-Dehqani – the “one outstanding candidate” – appointed archbishop of Canterbury, not least, he says, “because women are going to be more trusted on safeguarding than&nbsp;men”.</p> <p>While nobody expects that Welby’s resignation will arrest the long-term decline in church attendance, Paul argues that Britain is a less secular nation than is often believed. “There will be more Christians in church on a Sunday morning than people attending football matches at every level from schools up to professional,” he says.</p> <p>But a diminishing number of them are in Church of England ministries. How much this has to do with a country losing its religion, and how much it is a reflection of the church’s shrinking sociocultural relevance, is open to debate.</p> <p>What does seem clear, though, is that the church finds it hard to establish a coherent message because so much of its doctrinal teaching is subject to internal and international dispute. Nor is it adept at capitalising on wider social movements, partly for that reason.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/11/the-guardian-view-on-abuse-and-the-church-of-england-a-reckoning-is-due-for-a-shameful-failure">The Guardian view on abuse and the Church of England: a reckoning is due for a shameful failure | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One example is the rise in some quarters of what’s called “cultural Christianity”, a sort of secular appreciation of the religion’s active legacy, as well as the rituals and traditions that accompany it.</p> <p>Some critics suggest it is a movement born of anxiety about the cultural changes wrought by mass immigration, and in particular the rise of Islam.

                            title: 'Fish and chips for VE Day? Battle begins over how UK marks 80th anniversary'
                            content: '<p>People will be asked to eat fish and chips and sing I Vow To Thee My Country around a chain of beacons to mark the 80th anniversary next year of the end of the second world war.</p> <p>But the plans for 8 May, which are likely to involve the royal family and local councils, have failed to win the support of the government and the Royal British Legion, who have different – and arguably less traditional – ideas about how the day should be commemorated.</p> <p>Bruno Peek, the pageant master who has organised royal and national celebrations for more than 40 years and is behind the plans for VE Day, is frustrated that the government has distanced itself from his idea.</p> <p>“I would like the prime minister of the UK to help lead [I Vow to Thee My Country] at 9.30pm on 8 May,” Peek said. “I’m hoping that Sir Keir Starmer will stand up and sing with us.”</p> <p>The government has so far declined to commit to working with Peek or to endorse the plans for people to eat fish and chips, which is a nod to the fishermen who braved German U-boats and mines, and the farm workers who ensured that the national dish was among the few <a href="https://www.warhistoryonline.com/war-articles/fish-and-chips-british-soldier-morale.html">foodstuffs not rationed during the war</a>.</p> <p>Instead, the government and the Royal British Legion are working with other veterans’ representatives on their own, separate, £10m plans to celebrate and commemorate both VE Day, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/15/uk-to-mark-75th-anniversary-of-victory-over-japan-day">VJ (Victory over Japan) </a>Day in August.</p> <p>Peek has challenged Keir Starmer and MPs to work with him and to come out to support his plan for people to<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/aug/13/britishidentity.arts"> sing the hymn</a>, which is about love and sacrifice and derives from a poem by Sir Cecil Spring Rice, set to music by Gustav Holst.</p>    <p>“If I was Keir Starmer, I’d be on the phone to me right now, because I’ve got 43 years of experience of organising,” Peek, 73, said.</p> <p>The full details of the government and Royal British Legion’s plans have not yet been revealed but it is understood they are concerned about making remembrance more relevant to younger people and those from non-white backgrounds, as the number of armed forces families and those with direct links to the 1939-45 conflict decline.</p> <p>The legion is using VJ Day to support a campaign for a national memorial to the 2.5 million <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/27/armistice-centenary-indian-troops-testimony-sacrifice-british-library">members of the British Indian Army</a>, the biggest volunteer force in history, who served in the second world war.</p> <p>Philippa Rawlinson, the legion’s director of remembrance, wants to encourage people from Asian backgrounds to trace their own family histories of relatives who fought in the Indian Army.</p> <p>“Our challenge is that the armed forces community is getting smaller and society is changing. So we need to make sure that we are sharing stories that are relevant to wider society,” she said.</p> <p>The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) declined to say whether the prime minister and officials would endorse Peek’s chain of beacons, fish supper and hymn plans. Earlier this summer, Rishi Sunak supported Peek’s efforts to mark D-day’s 80th anniversary.</p> <p>A DCMS spokesperson said: “The 80th anniversaries of VE and VJ Days will be moments of huge significance for our country, and the government is committed to commemorating the occasions appropriately. That is why we have announced more than £10m for events. </p> <p>“We will announce the government’s plans to mark the occasion shortly.”</p> <p>Peek, who plans to retire after next year’s events, has often worked independently of government at previous national celebrations but is unimpressed. “This is why I get frustrated,” he said. “There are too many egos getting in the way.”</p> <p>“I’ve got all the parish, borough, and district councils working with me – the heartbeat of their local communities,” he said.</p> <p>He hopes that a boy and a girl, both aged eight to reflect the eight decades that have passed, will light the main beacon at the London Eye and added that his plans also reflect a multicultural Britain. “That hymn is one anyone who is proud of their country – any country – can sing, whatever their race, creed or colour,” he said.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Royal British Legion said: “I think we really need to be clear about what our plans are before we decide to work in partnership with anyone.”</p>'

                            title: 'Trump converts voters in deep-blue California – was it all about the economy?'
                            content: '<p>Donald Trump on 5 November expanded his coalition across the United States, and he did so even in deep-blue California.</p> <p>While Kamala Harris unsurprisingly beat out Trump in the Golden State – receiving about 60% of the vote – the former president nonetheless pulled off a victory, winning eight counties that supported Joe Biden in 2020.</p> <p>It may take years to fully understand the dynamics that contributed to the shift, but experts and political observers have so far pointed to the economy and diminished voter enthusiasm as key elements.</p> <p>Notorious for taking weeks to fully tally the election results, California is still finishing up its count. With more than 1m ballots left to sort through, the results could change, but as of Friday evening, Trump appears to have flipped eight counties from voting Democrat to Republican in the presidential race: Butte, Merced, Stanislaus, Fresno, San Joaquin, Inyo, San Bernardino and Riverside.</p> <p>The counties are concentrated in the state’s interior, from the Inland Empire east of Los Angeles to the agricultural heartland in the Central Valley. They’re generally more rural and not as progressive as population centers on the coast, and several are closely split between the parties while others are predominantly Democratic. Half of the counties backed a mix of Democrats and Republicans in US House races while one – Merced – supported a Democrat in its sole House contest.</p> <p>More than 1 million people voted for Trump in those areas, which are home to almost 7 million people.</p> <p>Polling by the <a href="https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/california/?r=0">Associated Press</a> and Norc at the University of Chicago suggest that California voters saw the economy as the most important issue facing the country, ahead of immigration, the climate and abortion access.</p> <p>It’s a trend seen across the country, said Mark Baldassare, the survey director at the Public Policy Institute of California, with voters<strong> </strong>feeling negatively about the economy and angry and dissatisfied at those currently in power. </p> <p>Like in other parts of the US, Trump appears to have been able to win over a larger share of young and Latino voters than he did before – although advocacy groups <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/trump-latino-support-polls-hispanic-vote-2024-election-rcna179932">disagree</a> about precisely how significant his gains were. In California, a decisive majority of Latino voters cast their ballots for Harris. Still, Trump managed to increase his share of the vote in most Latino-majority counties in California, according to <a href="https://calmatters.org/politics/elections/2024/11/california-election-latino-voters-trump/">CalMatters</a>, including Fresno and Riverside.</p> <p>Perceptions of the economy played a major role in the shift, organizers have said. “The most potent driver in the election was economic discontent, expressed in president-elect Donald Trump’s gains with most demographics,” Clarissa Martínez de Castro, the UnidosUS vice-president of the Latino Vote Initiative, said in a <a href="https://unidosus.org/press-releases/hispanic-voters-back-harris-over-trump-by-a-62-37-margin-cite-economic-concerns-as-top-priorities/">statement</a>, while emphasizing that most Latino voters backed Harris.</p> <p>Meanwhile, it appears turnout in California dropped from 2020, particularly among those who vote infrequently, said Baldassare.</p> <p>“That suggests that the more infrequent voters probably didn’t make it [and] didn’t feel motivated as they did in 2020, which of course was during the pandemic and a time of considerable political angst,” he said.</p> <p>Low-propensity voters that did make it to the polls may have been more motivated by the economy, Baldassare added.</p> <p>“That meant some people were voting for change in large enough numbers,” he said.</p> <p>Lisa Pruitt, a rural law expert at the University of California, Davis, said the results suggest some Californians believe the state’s policies have ventured too far left. Along with Trump’s gains, the state’s voters backed a measure to enact <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/05/california-prop-36-results">harsher penalties</a> for theft and drug offenses, and rejected an effort to ban <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/11/california-prop-6-fails">forced labor</a> in prisons. Progressive district attorneys in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/01/la-district-attorney-george-gascon-candidates-election">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/oakland-mayor-sheng-thao">Oakland</a> lost their seats.</p>    <p>“I think a lot of Californians think the state has moved too far to the left on crime, on so-called law and order – issues. And they are seeking a correction,” she said, adding that trans rights has also become a wedge issue for some voters.</p> <p>A state law banning school districts from requiring parental notification if a child makes changes to their gender identification has attracted fierce <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/17/gavin-newsom-lawsuit-gender-identity-law">backlash</a> in conservative parts of the state and drawn <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/02/california-town-rightwing-battle-schools-lgbtq">national attention</a>.</p> <p>“California is a bellwether of progressive politics and we are seeing a recoiling from that in our own state,” Pruitt said.</p> <p>But Trump’s victory in the US more broadly is part of a pattern that can be seen across the world, said James Adams, a political science professor at the University of California, Davis. Governing parties across the west, from Portugal to Finland to Germany are being voted out, and populist candidates are gaining support, Adams said.</p> <p>“The Republican party under Donald Trump is essentially a populist party with the message that the system is rigged and serves the interest of the rich and powerful and ignores ordinary people,” he said. “That message is one that seems to resonate across western democracies.”</p> <p>High inflation has eroded support for governing parties and confidence in their abilities to manage the economy, he added.</p> <p>Far northern California’s Butte county, which is evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, went to Trump. In Chico, the largest city in the county, however, voters supported Harris at similar levels they did Biden in 2020 and progressives were close to gaining a majority on the city council not seen in years.</p> <p>Addison Winslow, a progressive on Chico’s city council, attributes Trump’s gains to the Democratic party failing to acknowledge the economic realities for voters and put forward a candidate who people trust.</p> <p>“The anecdotal info I get is not that people are more conservative or more racist now or more hostile to progressive policies, but [that] the Democratic party has failed to put forward any national figures that the public trusts,” said Winslow.</p> <p>“What the Democrats have done is say, ‘Inflation isn’t that bad any more, the economy is actually really good,’” he said. “Maybe they can pull some economic indicators and say, ‘Look, I’m right’ but that just hasn’t been the personal experience of people.”</p>'

                            title: 'New Orleans’ elusive Scrim the dog once again on the lam after daring escape'
                            content: '<p>There are escape artists, and then there is the elusive dog from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-orleans">New Orleans</a> known as Scrim.</p> <p>A local pet-adoption service owner rescued the terrier from a dog pound where he faced the possibility of euthanasia – but Scrim then fled the home of a family that adopted him and spent about six months on the run before an elaborate effort to capture him succeeded in October, according to media outlets, including <a href="https://www.nola.com/entertainment_life/scrim-escaped-dog-first-day-captivity-new-orleans/article_d823d94e-924e-11ef-9e7c-7fa2077d8f08.html">Nola.com</a>.</p> <p>More than one social media user in the Big Easy joked that Scrim was “for the streets” rather than domesticity – and it now appears that may not have been a mere witticism. On Friday morning, Scrim busted through a second-floor window at the house where he was recovering from injuries incurred during his first escape, jumped about 13ft to the ground and again made a dash for freedom, the home’s owner, Michelle Cheramie, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCb9oyHRnuT/">wrote</a> on Saturday on her Zeus’ Rescues Instagram account.</p> <p>“Trust me when I say that there is nothing negative that you can say to me or about him getting loose again that I haven’t already said to myself in the last 24 hours,” read Cheramie’s post, which contained stunning home security camera video of Scrim plunging to the ground, sprinting through a wrought-iron fence and vanishing from view.</p> <p>Scrim had run more than two miles (3.2km) when the battery on his GPS collar died, once again leaving Cheramie and those who have helped her look for him with no clue to his precise whereabouts.</p> <p>Reuniting with Scrim during his first stint on the lam was no small feat.</p> <p>After Cheramie saved him from the dog pound, a family in New Orleans’ Mid-City neighborhood eventually adopted him. But Scrim quickly escaped and earned a measure of social media stardom as users posted videos from cellphones and security cameras whenever he was spotted jaunting through the streets.</p> <p>Those searching for him were equipped with traps, nets and tranquilizer guns, but he frustrated their efforts until Cheramie got a call the night of 23 October that Scrim had been sighted.</p> <p>Cheramie soon posted on social media: “WE GOT HIM!!!!”</p> <p>Scrim did not emerge from that run unscathed. He was missing a chunk out of his ear and had suffered various abrasions while X-rays revealed two projectiles – possibly small bullets or air rifle pellets – were lodged inside his little body, according to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/dog-captured-scrim-new-orleans-houdini-7575c851f790d2e01622c4f7a440415c">Associated Press</a>, citing information a veterinarian who examined Scrim told New Orleans media outlets.</p> <p>He and Cheramie ventured out on 7 November to the chambers of New Orleans’ city council, where civic leaders honored Scrim for displaying “resilience”, as one of the body’s members worded it. The plan was for Scrim to stay at Cheramie’s home to recover from his wounds before he was again put up for adoption.</p> <p>Scrim turned that plan on its head when, according to what Cheramie told Nola.com, he chewed through the screen of an open second-story window, squeezed through and leapt out.</p> <p>Cheramie wrote on Instagram that soon her team was distributing flyers and knocking on doors, asking people to keep a lookout for Scrim as a second search for him got under way.</p> <p>“I am not focusing on his escape but focusing all my mental energy on safely capturing him again,” Cheramie’s post said.</p> <p>“It took all of us coming together to find him last time. I am asking for your help again.”</p>'

                            title: "The week in TV: Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light; Bad Sisters; Immigration: How British Politics Failed; The Penguin –\_review"
                            content: '<p><strong>Wolf Hall: The Mirror </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>the Light</strong> (BBC One) | <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0024z1n/wolf-hall-the-mirror-and-the-light-1-wreckage">iPlayer</a><br><strong>Bad Sisters</strong> (<a href="https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/bad-sisters/umc.cmc.14kr4vv65unannh7doqgvlh20">Apple TV+</a>)<br><strong>Immigration: How British Politics Failed</strong> (BBC Two) | <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0024qb1/immigration-how-british-politics-failed-series-1-episode-1">iPlayer</a><br><strong>The Penguin</strong> (<a href="https://www.sky.com/watch/the-penguin">Sky Atlantic</a>/ <a href="https://www.nowtv.com/watch/the-penguin/iYEQZ2rcf32Y5xEUtq4wdY/iYsxVQTYrUBMYhe8hJKH8f/seasons/1">Now</a>)</p> <p>I ’m a huge fan of Hilary Mantel’s double Booker prize-winning <em>Wolf Hall</em> trilogy, and was frustrated and unimpressed by BBC Two’s 2015 dramatisation of the first two novels, <em>Wolf Hall</em> and <em>Bring Up </em><em>the Bodies</em>. Starring Mark Rylance as Henry VIII’s lowborn fixer, Thomas Cromwell, director Peter Kosminsky’s Bafta-winning adaptation felt as sluggish and laboured as Mantel’s writing was vivid and exciting. The series did ignite about two-thirds in, as Anne Boleyn (played with raw magnificence by Claire Foy) succumbed to trumped-up charges of treason, culminating in the unbearable, wind-lashed scenes of her beheading.</p> <p>Almost a decade later we’re plunged back into those terrible final moments in the opening episode of <strong><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0024z1n/wolf-hall-the-mirror-and-the-light-1-wreckage">Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light</a></strong>, based on Mantel’s concluding novel and again directed by Kosminsky and written by Peter Straughan. Here, Anne’s execution is intercut with Henry preparing for marriage to Jane Seymour (Kate Phillips) – the all-time king of toxic masculinity shrugging on weighty regalia and getting his beard trimmed in his latest bid for a legitimate male heir.</p> <p>“Such freshness, such delicacy,” he purrs of his wedding night to a guilt-ridden but carefully impassive Cromwell, who is rewarded by being made Lord Privy Seal. Alone, Cromwell is frequently visited by the ghost of his former master and true significant other, Cardinal Wolsey (Jonathan Pryce), who will soon remind him of Henry’s lethal caprice: “When fortune turns against you, you will feel the lash.”</p> <p>I suppose spoilers don’t count here; history contains all of those. Bar a few stodgy lulls, from the two episodes (of six) I’ve seen, this second series crackles with tension, driving forward the busy plot points: succession, ambition, peril, absolutism, religious turmoil, omnipresent female powerlessness and fear.</p> <p>Cromwell now seems much more akin to the self-possessed but uncompromising attack dog of the books. It also helps enormously to be able to see what’s happening; at times, the first series looked as if it had been filmed inside a candlelit Tudor duvet cover. Cast changes, such as Timothy Spall replacing the late Bernard Hill as the Duke of Norfolk, work well, while Lilit Lesser is dynamite as Catherine of Aragon’s daughter, Lady Mary.</p>    <p>Then there’s Damian Lewis. The role of Henry is tricky: easy to collapse into cosplay caricature. It doesn’t matter (to me, anyway) that the actor doesn’t look as if he reeks of Henry’s regal gout; it matters that he’s impulsive, mercurial, spoiled, shallow and petrifying, whether being applauded at masked balls by lickspittles or silkily glaring at Cromwell as, finally, the blacksmith’s son blunders into a huge mistake. Lewis is outstanding throughout.</p> <p>I was concerned about the second series of the jet-black comedy <strong><a href="https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/bad-sisters/umc.cmc.14kr4vv65unannh7doqgvlh20">Bad Sisters</a></strong> (Apple TV+). Could it be as compelling without Claes Bang as swaggering smoothie baddie John Paul, who was – spoiler klaxon – offed, after many demented attempts by the bickering Garvey sisters, trying to protect their sibling (his wife) Grace (Anne-Marie Duff). While the original <em>Bad Sisters</em> – adapted by Sharon Horgan, Dave Finkel and Brett Bauer from the Flemish series <em>Clan</em> – was meant as a standalone story, in season two, Horgan creates a new mystery and also writes some episodes.</p> <p>Early blissful scenes of Grace emerging, butterfly-like, from long-term abuse to marry new love Ian (Owen McDonnell) soon give way to the discovery of a corpse, chaos, desperation, police questioning, terrible tragedy and more for her sisters – played by Horgan (bossy Eva, who has a “menopause coach”), Eve Hewson (chaotic Becka, who performs a “nervous wee”), Eva Birthistle (perma-stressed medic Ursula) and Sarah Greene (foxy, eyepatch-sporting Bibi).</p>    <p>The plot becomes a little mangled, and while there are funny lines (“I love incense: it’s how I imagine Jesus smelled”), there are fewer than in the first series. That said, the ensemble playing remains pitch-perfect, and sweetly desperate neighbour Roger (Michael Smiley) is given a malevolent nosy churchwoman sister, Angelica, played with witchy naughtiness by Fiona Shaw. Yes, the suave horror of John Paul is missed, but over the course of eight episodes there’s still much to savour.</p> <p>New two-part BBC Two docuseries <strong><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0024qb1/immigration-how-british-politics-failed-series-1-episode-1">Immigration: How British Politics Failed</a></strong> is to be commended for tackling such a difficult subject, but it also proves the impossibility of having a coherent, intelligent national debate on the matter.</p> <p>Winding back to the early 00s, it’s interesting. Tony Blair talks about the migrant argument for economic growth. There’s an in-depth breakdown of major decisions and mistakes. There’s also a broad range of interviewees, including Andrew Green, whose Migration Watch thinktank produced data and analysis that David Cameron says proved “helpful” to the Conservatives.</p> <p>Unfortunately, every so often Nigel Farage bursts in, doing his Brexit panto routine. Early on he blares: “At least Tony Blair was honest. He said: We’re going to open the doors to the whole world.” (Yawn! Blair didn’t say that.) In next week’s episode, Farage says with ill-disguised relish: “Just you watch, this issue is going to get bigger and bigger.”</p> <p>Is his rather predictable input needed in all such documentaries? Couldn’t there just be a blank screen saying: “Please insert your own Nigel Farage bit here”? I’m not suggesting banning him (perish the thought!) – just giving him a wee rest on the topic of immigration. We can all agree he’s earned it.</p> <p>On Sky Atlantic, Lauren LeFranc’s <strong><a href="https://www.sky.com/watch/the-penguin">The Penguin</a></strong>, an eight-part TV-spin-off from 2022 film <em>The Batman</em>, concluded with the visceral virtuosity that, despite occasional slides into cheesy franchisedom, has made this the year’s most unexpected triumph. I won’t disclose the jaw-dropping and devastating late twist. I can reveal (lesser spoiler alert) that in the closing seconds, a bat logo appears in the sky above Gotham.</p>    <p>One of <em>The Penguin</em>’s secrets has been its committed story arc: it didn’t act like it had umpteen series to make a point. Nor was Oswald “Penguin” Cobb (Colin Farrell)<strong> </strong>played as a joke, but as an intimidating mobster, a charismatic leader, who wears his ugliness on the inside yet still has some to spare on the outside. Farrell’s achievement is that you forget he’s larded in a veritable acreage of prosthetics. You just remember his performance, and it’s staggering.</p> <p><em>Star ratings (out of five)<br>Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light</em> <strong>★★★★</strong><br><em>Bad Sisters</em> <strong>★★★★</strong><br><em>Immigration: How British Politics Failed</em> <strong>★★★</strong><br><em>The Penguin</em> <strong>★★★★</strong></p> <h2>What else I’m watching</h2> <p><strong><a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81685880">Sprint</a><br></strong>(Netflix)<br>The return of the fascinating fly-on-the-wall documentary about international sprinters – among them the irrepressible US champion Noah Lyles.

                            title: 'Cock review: love lies bleeding in Mike Bartlett’s bitter romantic triangle'
                            content: '<p>How charged and potent words can be. And how they can mislead. The title of British playwright Mike Bartlett’s 2009 play is principally a reference to the cockfights he saw in Mexico. But this bait-and-switch is merely the starting gun of a play about the slipperiness of language and labels: gay, straight, boyfriend, brother. Their elasticity is strained and snapped.</p> <p>It’s a tension that buzzes through this new production – the first time the play has been seen in the north of England. Joe Gill plays John, the only named character, who confesses to his boyfriend, M, at the start to cheating on him with a woman, W. The play rolls through the fallout, rewinds to John’s first encounter with W, then culminates in them all meeting for a prickly dinner.</p> <p><em>Cock</em> – first staged in 2009 – dates from Bartlett’s early career, before he turned to political subjects such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/13/charles-iii-birdland-small-family-business-review">King Charles III</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/17/the-great-middlemarch-mystery-coventry-review-the-47th-mike-bartlett-bertie-carvel-old-vic-for-black-boys-who-have-considered-suicide-when-the-hue-gets-too-heavy-ryan-calais-cameron-royal-court">Donald Trump</a>. But it was a time when sexual fluidity was less examined – and accepted – than today, and the drama hangs on an obligation to define your sexuality that feels a little dated.</p> <p>Director Rupert Hill confidently controls the bombast of Bartlett’s script, with its elaborate metaphors and narrated sex scene, so it lands less like engineered provocation. Gill’s John, described as “fudge”, droops and sags like a marionette awaiting a puppeteer. John O’Neill’s M glowers, his frenzied agitation suggesting insecurity about John from the start. Hannah Ellis Ryan is poised and needle-like as the disruptor. If they overgesticulate, the effect is of characters grasping for fixed points and physical connection.</p> <p>The volleying and jockeying plays out on a chalked rectangle resembling a sports court, audience on either side of the traverse stage.

                            title: 'Improving social care is a big task and these talks are a good place to start | Heather Stewart'
                            content: '<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/kemi-badenoch">Kemi Badenoch</a>’s second go at prime minister’s questions last Wednesday was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/13/kemi-badenoch-is-her-own-worst-enemy-and-a-gift-to-keir-starmer-and-labour-pmqs">judged a flop</a> at Westminster but she did draw attention to one genuine issue: the impact of the national insurance rise for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/social-care">social care</a>.</p> <p>It is 14 years since the Tories sank Andy Burnham’s plan for a “death tax” to fund social care. Over that time, as demand has continued to rise, there have been patches and sticking plasters, including the social care precept, and the decision to fill gaping holes in the workforce with a surge in overseas workers.</p> <p>But the basic picture, of overstretched staff, under-resourced councils, and families (including mine) juggling the emotional distress of a declining relative with the costs of ensuring that they are well looked after, has only worsened.</p> <p>And so we find ourselves in 2024, with councils wondering how they can meet the costs of April’s tax increases. (Scotland and Wales take different approaches but many of the underlying pressures are similar.)</p> <p>Eagle-eyed experts spotted a revealing late correction to official budget forecasts last week.</p> <p>As Andrew Harrop, a former chair of the Fabian Society, pointed out, the Office for Budget Responsibility had initially assumed the Treasury would compensate the sector for the costs of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/national-insurance">national insurance</a> contributions (NICs) rise but later corrected itself.</p> <p>The difference between the two published figures revealed that the OBR expects the employer NICs rise alone to cost social care employers £800m. That more than swallows up the £600m extra that Rachel Reeves promised the sector in the budget, and which Keir Starmer shot back at Badenoch.</p> <p>Add in the (welcome) chunky rise in the “national living wage” in April, and workforce costs are likely to rise by more than £1bn. Harrop issued a warning: “If extra money is not found to compensate for the tax rise the consequences will be dire.” </p> <p>This uncertainty is just the latest indication of social care’s neglected status. Short-term crunches such as these will keep recurring until politicians have the courage to agree a more sustainable funding model.</p> <p>Social care reform is a live issue at the top of government, with Starmer expected to take the final decision about whether to hold a royal commission, or an internal government review. Such a review seems unlikely to unearth new solutions – though perhaps, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/24/social-care-review-may-work-this-time-realistic-plan">as my colleague Polly Toynbee</a> argues, it could help to make the argument for unpalatable ones.</p> <p>Meanwhile, though, Angela Rayner and Wes Streeting are pressing ahead with a quietly radical plan that could yet be the key to prising open the problem. The pair convened a meeting earlier this month at which employers, unions and local authorities began discussions about negotiating minimum standards for pay and conditions in social care, which the government would then enforce across the sector in England, by law.</p> <p>This idea, of a “fair pay agreement”, was part of the Make Work Pay agenda in Labour’s manifesto. It is ambitious: there are an estimated 18,500 care providers, ranging from individual homes run as small businesses, to big chains backed by private equity, via a whole ecosystem of charities. Even establishing who should sit around the table is a challenge.</p> <p>While it has been named a fair <em>pay</em> agreement, it could potentially be a vehicle for progress on other aspects of care workers’ lives, such as shift patterns and allowance for travel time.</p> <p>Career progression is another issue. Staff with five years’ experience earn just 10p an hour more than new starters.</p> <p>One relevant model is the vast Agenda for Change bargaining unit, which covers more than a million workers across the health service. But unlike there, the taxpayer does not foot the entire bill for social care: an estimated 37% of residents in care homes are self-funded, for example. That makes ministers’ role more ambiguous.</p> <p>Also unlike the NHS, union density in the social care sector is relatively low. Unions, including Unison and the GMB, hope that representing workers in a formal arrangement like this will be a powerful recruiting tool – but at the outset there will be questions of legitimacy on both sides of the table.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Rayner and Streeting’s engagement is a clear signal that the government is serious.</p> <p>It might seem topsy-turvy to begin here – before we can say how any uplift be paid for. Yet perhaps the working conditions at the coalface of care are a more humane starting point for policy than the drive to cap consumers’ costs.</p> <p>Even more so than for many other public services, social care <em>is</em> its workforce. Having modern, purpose-built infrastructure is helpful; new tech might save time in rota management; but, ultimately, care is made up of myriad human interactions.</p> <p>Improving productivity – and quality – is likely to require a better-motivated workforce that does not have to be constantly recruited and trained as staff flee for better-paid alternatives.</p> <p>Turnover was more than 25% in 2023-24; in other words, more than one in four care workers changed job. About one in 10 leaves the sector altogether each year.</p> <p>The workforce development body, Skills for Care, reckons that the UK <a href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/Adult-Social-Care-Workforce-Data/Workforce-intelligence/publications/national-information/The-size-and-structure-of-the-adult-social-care-sector-and-workforce-in-England.aspx">will need more than half a million additional care workers</a> by 2040 to cope with rising need in an ageing society. There is no route to achieving that without raising the pay and status of caring as a profession. And it’s a feminist issue: almost 80% of care workers are women.</p> <p>It will not be cheap: Skills for Care calculates that lifting hourly pay to £1 above the minimum wage, and allowing for better progression, would cost taxpayers £2bn a year – though the government’s <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/671259d59cd657734653d7e5/impact-assessment-establish-a-fair-pay-agreements-process-in-the-adult-social-care-sector.pdf">impact assessment</a> estimates that the treasury would get 40p of every £1 back in increased taxes and lower benefit payments.</p> <p>Putting a floor under pay and conditions would also help to ensure that additional funding finds its way to the workforce instead of seeping out in profits.</p> <p>Clearly, terms and conditions for social care workers cannot be divorced from the pressing need to ensure significantly more money flows into this sector, not just in the short-term but sustainably.</p> <p>But opening up a conversation with the 1.6 million people doing this vital job, often on poverty pay, seems as good a way as any of understanding the shape of the challenge for social care, and what could be won if we crack it.</p>'

                            title: 'Mystery surrounds 800-year-old Leicester burial pit containing 123 bodies'
                            content: '<p>In gardens a few metres from Leicester Cathedral, archaeologists have made a disturbing discovery. Their excavations have revealed a narrow vertical shaft filled with the remains of 123 men, women and children.</p> <p>It is one of the largest pit burials ever excavated in the UK, with subsequent research suggesting the bodies were dumped there more than 800 years ago, early in the 12th century.</p> <p>However, the reasons for putting the corpses in this tiny, ancient shaft remain a mystery.</p> <p>“Their bones show no signs of violence – which leaves us with two alternative reasons for these deaths: starvation or pestilence,” said Mathew Morris, project officer at Leicester University’s archaeological services. “At the moment, the latter is our main working hypothesis.”</p> <p>The excavations by Morris and his colleagues suggest the bodies were put into the shaft in three deposits, in rapid succession. “It looks as if successive cartloads of bodies were brought to the shaft and then dropped into it, one load on top of another in a very short space of time,” he said. “In terms of numbers, the people put in there probably represented about 5% of the town’s population.”</p> <p>The discovery of the mass burial provides a vivid insight into life in England more than eight centuries ago, said Morris. “Other pit burials have been found in the region but this is the biggest. Actually, just trying to find comparable pit burials anywhere in the country is proving really hard.”</p> <p>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles repeatedly mention great pestilences and fevers, severe mortality, and miserable deaths from hunger and famine in England from the mid-10th century through to the mid-12th century, said Morris. “This mass burial fits within this timeframe and provides physical proof of what was then occurring across the nation.”</p>    <p>The discovery of the mass burial is the result of a decision to build a new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/22/richard-iii-visitor-centre-leicester">heritage learning centre</a> at the cathedral. Twelve years ago, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/24/richard-iii-leicester-car-park-steve-coogan-philippa-langley-lost-king">body of Richard III </a>was found underneath a nearby car park and was subsequently buried in the cathedral, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-67090903#:~:text=%C2%A312.7m.-,The%20cathedral%20said%20visitor%20numbers%20had%20increased%20ten%2Dfold%20since,made%20the%20work%20more%20urgent.">triggering a tenfold rise in visitor numbers</a>. To cope with this influx, a new centre supported by the National Lottery Heritage Fund was approved for construction in the cathedral’s garden, a former burial ground, after a full archaeological survey had been carried out.</p> <p>This has now been completed by Morris and his colleagues. In the garden, they uncovered the remains of 1,237 men, women and children, ranging from those buried in the 19th century, down to those who were interred in the early 11th century.</p> <p>“It’s a continuous sequence of 850 years of burials from a single population from a single place, and you don’t get that very often,” added Morris. “It has generated an enormous amount of archaeology.”</p>    <p>Below these burials, the team found evidence of Anglo-Saxon dwellings and, further beneath, a Roman shrine. But most striking of all was the small vertical burial shaft that was discovered at one side of the dig: the pit burial containing the remains of 123 individuals.</p> <p>At first, the team assumed these people had died during the Black Death, the outbreak of bubonic plague that struck England in 1348 and which is thought to have killed between a third and a half of the population.</p> <p>“We initially thought this was going to be the first evidence of the Black Death arriving in Leicester,” said Morris. Then the team got the results of radiocarbon dating tests of bones from the pit. These showed that the bodies had been dumped there almost 150 years earlier, around the beginning of the 12th century.</p> <p>“That was surprising,” Morris admitted. “We have no idea, at present, what might have triggered such a massive cause of death. As far as we know, the bubonic plague did not reach our shores until 1348. So what was the cause of the mass deaths that occurred then?”</p>    <p>To find answers to this question, the Leicester team has sent samples from the bodies in the pit to geneticists at the Francis Crick Institute in London in order to search for viruses, bacteria or parasites that might have triggered the blight that struck Leicester.</p> <p>“It was clearly a devastating outbreak that resonates with recent events, in particular the Covid pandemic,” said Morris. “But it is also important to note there was still some form of civic control going on. There was still someone going around in a cart collecting bodies. What we see from studying the bodies in the pit does not indicate it was created in a&nbsp;panic.”</p> <p>He added: “There was also no evidence of clothing on any of the bodies – no buckles, brooches, nothing to suggest these were people who were dropping dead in the street before being collected and dumped.</p> <p>“In fact, there are signs that their limbs were still together, which suggests they were wrapped in shrouds. So their families were able to prepare these bodies for burial before someone from a central authority collected them to take to the pit burial.”</p>'

                            title: 'To turn Britain around, we need a proper understanding of life for poorer workers | Torsten Bell'
                            content: '<p>Things have not being going well for low- and middle-income Britain: wages flatlining, public services crumbling and, as a result, faith in mainstream politics eroding. To start turning things around, it pays to understand the country as it exists today, not as it once was or as you imagine it to be.</p> <p>So, we should all pay attention to “Unsung Britain”, a major research project from my old Resolution Foundation colleagues, which aims to provide an audit of the circumstances and challenges of the poorer half of the working-age population. <a href="https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/unsung-britain/">Their launch report</a> already has important lessons.</p> <p>First, improving health and wealth are not separate objectives. Those on low-to-middle incomes are more than five times more likely than richer people to be out of work because of ill health. When critics say the budget’s extra money for the NHS does nothing for growth, they are missing the point.</p> <p>Second, poorer Britain <em>is</em> working. Yes, recent rising ill health has reduced employment, but the long view is that employment among low-to-middle income families is up nine percentage points since the mid-90s. There has been no rise among richer households. Contrary to many headlines, the share of poorer families in which no one is working has near halved since Tony Blair came to power (from 24% to 13%). Today, we need to improve the pay, security and volatility of people’s work.</p> <p>Third, the feeling of being squeezed is real. Half of low-to-middle income families’ spending went on essentials (like food and housing) at the start of the century. Now? In part due to higher housing costs, essentials eat up £3 out of every £5. We need to build, build, build. Our social contract hasn’t delivered for millions. It’s time to understand our country, so we can change it. </p> <p>• Torsten Bell is Labour MP for Swansea West and author of <em>Great Britain? How We Get Our Future Back</em></p>'

                            title: 'Pink fishy goo makes bad news palatable | David Mitchell'
                            content: '<p>Have you ever asked yourself a question along the lines of: “If you had to choose not to eat bread or not to eat potatoes, what would you go for?”, or perhaps: “If you had to either never ever have a starter or never ever have a pudding, which would you pick?” You probably have. Maybe not while alone, but as part of some desultory group chat. Though perhaps you rise above it – these are very hypothetical scenarios, after all. Who exactly is going to say that forever after you can only have starters or puddings? Donald Trump? It doesn’t strike me as his style. Keir Starmer might float the idea since he’s so worried about the NHS, but then he’d pub-garden it within 48 hours. Perhaps you’ll develop type 2 diabetes and have to give up desserts but there won’t be any scope for bargaining. “I simply must have meringue but I’m willing to swear off paté and prawn cocktails in exchange” is not an argument any reputable doctor will accept.</p> <p>It’s diverting, though, in a bland way. If you’re at all interested in yourself, and it’s probably a mental health red flag if you’re not, you can’t help pondering it a bit. “Ooh, I love a roast potato, but instead of toast? That’s a poser. I think I’d have to keep toast.” That’s a little snippet from my own scintillating interior monologue, by the way. “Starters ahead of puddings. Every day of the week.” And there’s another. Like thinking about what you’d do if you ruled the world or won the lottery, it provokes harmless little explorations of what you’re like. “Do you know, I wouldn’t actually want it to be Christmas every day because then it wouldn’t be a treat,” you can proudly announce to yourself and any of the others in the chat. And hopefully there’s no rise-abover who’ll say: “Remind me, are we mortal or immortal, we humans? It’s mortal, isn’t it. We’re mortal. So what the hell is this?!”</p> <p>These little thought experiments were brought to mind by reports of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/12/shoppers-bemoan-uk-taramasalata-shortage-as-strike-leads-to-dip-in-supply">UK’s current severe shortage of taramasalata</a>. You can probably guess the cause. Yes, it’s industrial action in Spalding, as you suspected. As a result, most supermarkets are denuded of all tubs of pink fishy goo. If you’re ranking dips (which you really might get on to after deciding you’d definitely illegalise split-toe trainers and go for both an indoor and an outdoor pool because why not), you might say that taramasalata is your favourite. I mean, you might. But it’s surely got to be Pepsi to hummus’s Coke, right? – if that comparison works despite Pepsi and Coke, unlike taramasalata and hummus, being near identical. In this analogy, I reckon tzatziki would maybe be Fanta, but obviously without the Nazi origin story.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>Limoncello is a regrettable liquid and only marginally preferable to dying of thirst</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some people have been really thrown by it, with one X user saying her family had been forced into sourcing their taramasalata from restaurants. I suppose there was nothing else they could have done. I must say I find this a rather relaxing shortage. In a universe where I would give up potatoes if I could continue to have toast, what would I give up to continue to have taramasalata? Not much. Not crisps, for example. Not even crinkle-cut crisps. Maybe one packet of crisps – although I’m not sure. Three crisps. I would forgo three crisps to keep taramasalata in my life. And I don’t dislike it. It’s fine.</p> <p>Limoncello! I would swap limoncello for taramasalata. I certainly wouldn’t mix them – except under circumstances where I’d accidentally ingested poison and a stomach pump was unavailable. But, yes, I don’t mind never having limoncello if I can still have taramasalata. And that sentence remains true without the phrase “if I can still have taramasalata”. Limoncello is a regrettable liquid – I mean, it’s barely a liquid, it makes Benylin seem runny – and only marginally preferable to dying of thirst.</p> <p>Still, shortages can be unsettling. They bring back memories of early Covid and the spectre of a British public racked with disease and unable even to wipe our own bottoms. But compared with the likes of loo roll, flour, pasta and paracetamol, taramasalata is vanilla – and indeed might be substituted with vanilla if you’ve put it on any forthcoming Ocado orders.</p> <p>Like shortages, supermarket deliveries were something many of us first encountered because of Covid. We experienced first the terror of being unable to go and buy food, then the magic of it just turning up without having to – though this miracle was soon obscured by the fog of annoyance at their bizarre substitutions. Who decides this? A very stupid human or a third-rate algorithm? I wanted cranberry sauce not ketchup! What were they thinking? Jesus Christ, they’ve substituted celeriac for parsnips, a poussin for a turkey, a joke plastic dog turd for a Tesco Finest Cumberland ring and low-fat mayonnaise for mayonnaise! I <em>hate</em> low-fat mayonnaise!</p> <p>The most severe shortage at the moment is of course good news. Everything feels a bit bleak; hot on the heels of a British election that seemed like cause for hope of a more civilised and benevolent few years comes an American one that promises only riots, bullshit, a confidence boost for the Ku Klux Klan and a warm embrace of climate catastrophe.</p> <p>Strictly speaking, this taramasalata situation is more bad news. There’s an industrial dispute going on between members of the trade union Unite and their employer Bakkavor at its Spalding processing plant. Unite says its members have received below inflation pay rises for years, Bakkavor sees it otherwise. This row will be no metaphorical picnic for the people involved and, as a result, the literal picnics of the nation have been jeopardised.</p> <p>Yet, in the absence of anything genuinely positive, a substitution must be made. We need to manufacture ersatz good news and, for me, that’s what the taramasalata shortage is. It’s very stressful for several hundred people and mildly irritating for millions but, looked at in context, it is so much less bad than the coverage surrounding it, that it actively looks nice, like the seeming brightness of a dark grey shape on a pitch black background.</p>'

                              title: '‘It has been a year since I felt joy’: Paul Sagar on coming to terms with the climbing accident that paralysed him'
                              content: '<p>Paul Sagar, 37, is reader in political theory in the department of political economy at King’s College London. He studied at the universities of Cambridge, Oxford and London and in 2020 received the British and Irish Association for Political Thought early career award for excellence in research and teaching. A once passionate rock climber, he suffered a catastrophic accident last year while climbing in Scotland. The accident left him tetraplegic, paralysed from the collarbones down, with only residual use of his hands. After eight months in hospital, he resumed academic work in early 2024, continuing physical rehabilitation and attempting to adjust to life with severe disability. This is an extract from his diary of the past 16 months.</p> <h2><strong>22 August 2023</strong></h2> <p>On 5 June, I was climbing in Glencoe with a friend. Because of friability in the rock, a route we had thought to be in unusually safe condition turned out to be almost lethal. On the final pitch, as I was leading, the rock collapsed and much of my gear exploded out of the placements. I fell about 20 metres. My left arm was shattered severely, and my right arm was also broken, albeit less badly. Worst of all I fractured two vertebrae in my neck.</p> <p>Luckily, I was climbing with a surgeon that day and through amazing good fortune and his incredible skill and composure, he saved my life. I was airlifted to Glasgow hospital where I had several operations and awoke four weeks later. After a period of drug-induced insanity I eventually came to something like my senses. Since then, I have been transferred to the Royal London hospital, where I am undergoing the start of a very long physio journey.</p> <p>At present, I have limited use of my hands and no control of my body below my abdominal muscles. This is not exactly how I planned to spend my summer, to say the least.</p> <p>I have written this short post using voice dictation software, partly just to prove to myself that I can. The likelihood is I will never walk again, let alone climb.</p> <h2><strong>1 September</strong></h2> <p>If I had to pick the single worst thing about living in hospital, there would be some stiff competition. There is the constant disruption, having no control over when I wake up, with people barging into the room at whatever time suits them to jab me with needles or slam bin lids. There is the total dependency on others to complete the most mundane of tasks, be it feeding myself or getting my teeth brushed. There is the infuriating frequency with which staff will talk about me when I’m in the room, or ask each other questions that I know the answers to, but which they do not bother to consult me about because the default assumption is that the patient is clueless.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>I want to be an able-bodied man with his life back. The fact this is impossible doesn’t stop me wanting it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, the number one worst thing about being an early stage spinal injury patient in hospital is, for me at least, the daily humiliation. You see, an aspect of spinal injury I wasn’t aware of until it happened to me is that it’s not just that you lose the ability to use your legs and possibly your hands . You also lose functional control of your bowels and bladder. </p> <p>Hence this week I underwent a minor surgery to drill a tube directly into my bladder, making my penis effectively redundant. I have anyway by now lost count of the number of strangers who have either seen or had to wash my genitals.</p>    <h2><strong>11 September</strong></h2> <p>Who am I? It’s hard to be sure any more. In recent days I have found it harder and harder to shake the feeling that I am an impostor. Increasingly I am struck with the sense that somebody did die that day in early June. I share his name, his legal details, his date of birth, and even his memories. Other people seem to think that I am him. But I am increasingly unsure. I look at the arms attached to me now, and they are thin like twigs. Forearms have disappeared completely, while biceps are a rump of what once was. When I have glanced at my chest during occasions of being washed, I am astounded to see that it simply no longer exists. There is just flat bone above visible ribs. When attempting to do the most basic of exercises, a mind that remembers developing serious core strength over years tries to engage abdominal muscles that cannot perform even the beginning of a single measly sit-up. And then, of course, there are the hands that barely function and the legs that do not move at all. The person who woke up on 5 June looked and felt absolutely nothing like this.</p> <p>Somebody died that day, and somebody different survived. I am the survivor, playing the role once held by a dead man, and every day slightly puzzled as to why nobody seems to have noticed the switch.</p> <h2><strong>1 October</strong></h2> <p><em>I am now in the </em><em>rehab department</em><em> at the </em><em>Royal National Orthopaedic hospital</em><em> at </em><em>Stanmore, Middlesex</em><em>.</em></p> <p>Conversation matters. It distracts me from my situation and connects me to a world beyond my circular thoughts. But it’s also risky. Topics that ought to be safe are, for me, not necessarily so.</p> <p>Take the weather. Comments on the unseasonable warmth we’re having are tough for me to hear. Yes, it means I can visit the rehab centre gardens. On the other hand, I immediately think of how I’m not out climbing in such perfect weekend conditions. And never will be again.</p> <p>Many remarks can trigger pain without the other person meaning to, or even realising. Take the friendly Irish nurse who tonight told me of her love of hiking in the Peak District, her trips to the Lake District, her walks in Switzerland. It took all my strength not to reply <em>you have no fucking idea</em>. <em>I didn’t just hike those places. I saw and accessed sights you can’t even imagine</em>. And then my mind is flooded with all the places I’ll never see again. The North London Mountaineering Club hut in Snowdonia, my home from home that I planned to visit regularly until I died. Wen Zawn at Gogarth. My favourite Kalymnos bar. Portland sport routes. The Borrowdale trad crags. The view of Italy from 3,000m. The feeling of slinging a full rucksack back into the van after a long day’s effort. Wyoming. El Chorro. Fontainebleau. Never again. And the list goes on.</p> <p>It might sound strange but the emotion I feel in relation to this is heartbreak. I realised this today after a kind nursing assistant asked me (respectfully, in appropriate circumstances) what my accident had been. I told her the story. And then I began to cry. A 36-year-old man in tears, in front of a near stranger.</p> <h2><strong>5 October</strong></h2> <p>The truth is I’m finding rehab very hard. After spending nearly three months fixating on getting here, the reality of starting intensive physio and therapy is not the instant salvation I had hoped it would be.</p> <p>The rehab team gave me a power wheelchair this week, which restores a modicum of independence. All I can think about, however, is how small the rehab centre is, having now lapped it dozens of times. And about how winter will soon make even the gardens inaccessible. And this is where I will spend every day for months. The other night we were lucky enough to listen to music performed live in the large outdoor pod. Upbeat songs about love and joy? They just make me think about how I don’t have a partner, I don’t have children, and I’ve realistically blown any chance at either from here on out. So what is left to give the fight meaning? What’s the point?</p>    <h2><strong>19 October</strong></h2> <p>I am no longer the only published author among the patients at rehab. Indeed, I’m not even close to being the most widely read any more. That’s because a couple of weeks ago <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/12/my-body-is-broken-but-im-not-going-to-give-up-hanif-kureishi-on-life-after-the-accident-that-paralysed-him">Hanif Kureishi</a> arrived to also undergo rehabilitation. As well as being a successful novelist and screenwriter, Hanif directly inspired me to start these blogs. That’s because he has been dictating Substack posts via his partner and children since he suffered a debilitating spinal cord injury himself on Boxing Day last year. I was made aware of his regular “dispatches” while in Royal London hospital, and read all of them. It was helpful to hear what somebody else going through the same kind of experience as me was making of it, and it brought me solace when he wrote about struggling with some of the same things that I have. More generally it made me think that if he could write, then I should try writing too. And so I did.</p> <p>Hanif and I have had a couple of good conversations since he arrived, but nothing is ever easy in this new life and he is now mostly isolated for infection control reasons.</p> <h2><strong>3 December</strong></h2> <p>I’ve written before about how utterly overwhelming this experience is. Well it turns out that it doesn’t get easier with time. I didn’t realise one could be overwhelmed by constantly feeling overwhelmed. Overwhelm fatigue. Metawhelmed, if you like. That’s where I’m at right now. My mind is a cacophony of paradoxical, or at least incoherent, thoughts.</p> <p>Here’s an example. Last week was my “case conference”, when the therapists and medical leads here sat down with my parents and I to discuss my progress to date, and future steps. They congratulated me on having made real gains as a result of trying very hard in my various physio and therapy sessions, and therefore extending my admission by another month. This is only done for people who have made progress and whom it is believed will make further gains if they stay longer. By no means does everyone get extended.</p> <p>Great news for me, right? Of course I can see that this is ultimately positive. My parents were a little baffled, however, as to why I nonetheless apparently took so little cheer from it. The answer is that I find it hard to be uplifted by progress towards a goal that I fundamentally don’t want. The brute truth is that I don’t want to be a better-than-expected tetraplegic. I want to be an able-bodied man with his life back. And the fact this is impossible doesn’t stop me wanting it. </p> <h2><strong>26 January 2024</strong></h2> <p>If nothing else, the past half a year has made me acutely aware of how dependent on family one becomes even while living in the heart of the NHS. If it weren’t for my mother and father, I would be truly screwed. It would have been impossible for me to single-handedly deal with things like securing accommodation for the future, let alone communicating with my employer and various crucial organisations during the first few months of my injury. As far as I can tell, after an accident like mine, those who don’t have family to pick up the pieces are in the direst of dire&nbsp;straits.</p> <p>So I’m lucky to have parents who care enough, and are competent enough and financially stable enough, to offer me serious help in rebuilding something like a life. And for this, of course, I am grateful. Which leads to a question: why then do I sometimes behave like such a shit?</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>The most painful thing is sorting old clothes. Every item had a connection to my former life and put a dagger through my heart</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Last weekend was not my finest hour. Having made the long trek down from Merseyside to the rehab centre just outside Watford, my mum and dad came to spend time with me. And I rewarded them with toddler levels of truculence and incivility. Why can’t I behave nicely, as a fitting display of the gratitude that I do genuinely feel towards them?</p> <p>The answer I think lies, at least in part, in the fact that half a year ago I was an independent adult with his own income, career, projects, and so forth, but I am now effectively reduced to the status of a child. I need Mummy and Daddy to help me with everything in life. And this is a very difficult thing to come to terms with. And if one is now living like a baby, why not act like one?</p> <p>Add to that the fact that I’m now in the position of having to be grateful <em>all the time</em>: to the person that wipes my arse, to whoever washes me, or puts my clothes on or brushes my teeth. I am grateful to the person that brings my lunch out and puts it in front of me, to the nurse who puts my afternoon medication into my mouth. I am grateful to the staff in the gym that I spend most of the day with, most of whom by now have had to cope with either my piss or shit at least once. I am grateful to whichever persons put me to bed before propping up my iPad so that I can watch some crap on Netflix before falling asleep and repeating it all again.</p> <p>The result of this is what one might call gratitude exhaustion. </p> <h2><strong>5 February</strong></h2> <p>One of the many things that I never appreciated about my old life is that I was virtually never bored. My work consisted mostly of reading and discussing interesting ideas with colleagues and students. If I got bored during the day, I’d amuse myself by playing online chess (poorly). I trained for climbing 10 to 15 hours a week, while weekends were almost always spent driving somewhere it wasn’t raining so as to climb outdoors.</p> <p>Evenings after training left time for good-quality TV, or reading a novel. And of course there were always friends to catch up with in London if I ever felt like actually being sociable. Failing that, I’d go fishing. Essentially, if I was awake I was active, either in body or mind. A lazy weekend, doing nothing, was something like my idea of a bad time.</p> <p>The contrast with my new life could hardly be more stark. I now regularly spend chunks of time just doing nothing. </p> <p>The strangest thing, though, is how accustomed I have become to this mode of living. Seconds become minutes, become hours, become days. Time just drifts by unfilled, and I watch as it passes. I’m bored, but weirdly indifferent about that boredom. It doesn’t drive me crazy like it would have before. I’ve become somebody else; somebody I don’t especially admire, but who seems worryingly like they are here to stay.</p> <h2><strong>10 March</strong></h2> <p>I have now moved on to a nursing home. There is no doubt that it is an improvement on living behind a curtain in a hospital ward. Nonetheless, I have the sense of starring in my own personal <em>Groundhog</em> <em>Day</em>. Every day is basically the same. Mornings are lost, waiting for my various needs to be dealt with. Afternoons I spend trying to work, with decreasing levels of enthusiasm. Evenings I play some online chess, wondering how it is possible to get progressively worse as the days pass. Then it is back to bed for yet more TV. Rinse, repeat. I never go anywhere new. I have no plans. There are no holidays to look forward to. No weekends away. Just more of the same, day after day. Bill Murray, I get it now.</p> <p>And so it might not be especially surprising to hear that I am not doing very well psychologically. Leaving the hell of rehab, getting some minimal privacy, and being able to read serious work for the first time in months gave me an initial mental boost. But it is not especially surprising that this was not a magic cure. And yet I am still taken aback by the scale of my mental collapse. I feel as hopeless, as unable to accept and adapt, as at any other time since I regained consciousness. For a few weeks, I genuinely thought I was getting better. I do not feel even remotely close to that any more.</p>    <p>All of which has led me to a decision. I have begun the process of formally applying to Dignitas, with the eventual possibility of assisted suicide. Many more steps will be required if I am ultimately to go through with this, and I will have the option of changing my mind at many points in the future. (Some people have tried to tell me that I will not be eligible because I am not terminally ill, but I have done my research and although there is no guarantee that I will be accepted for consideration, tetraplegics from Britain have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/27/the-britons-who-made-their-final-journey-to-dignitas-clinic">used the Swiss service before</a>.) At the very least, what this gives me is the psychological comfort of knowing there is an escape route. I am so tired of feeling completely trapped, forced to stay alive by other people, with all the power and control removed from my own life. Even if I don’t take the option, knowing that the option is at least there provides a kind of comfort: the knowledge that I still have a final small amount of meaningful agency, that I can finally make this <em>stop</em> if I want to.</p> <h2><strong>11 May</strong></h2> <p>Last week I completed the long process of losing my home. The apartment I lived in for three years has changed hands, and now belongs to somebody else. And it hurts so much.</p> <p>The place was very modest; just a small one-bedroom flat. But it was <em>mine</em>. Those were my bookshelves. My choices of mountainscape on the wall. My arrangement of furniture. My base of operations for work, whenever I wasn’t travelling, trying to get as much time in the great outdoors as I could. Shortly before my accident, as a way of channelling the emotional pain from the breakup of a four-year relationship I had repainted most of the walls and doors, even had a new carpet fitted in the bedroom. And then one day I walked out and drove away, not knowing that it was for the last time. Nobody told me that I would never see the place again. I never got to say goodbye.</p> <h2><strong>5 June</strong></h2> <p>It has been a year to the day since my accident. A year since I woke up somewhere peaceful, somewhere quiet, at a time of my own choosing. Since it was up to me alone how long I stayed in bed. A year since I could piss standing up, of my own volition, rather than it dribbling out of me into a plastic bag. A year since I made my own breakfast. Since I was able to lift a normal cup of coffee. A year since I was able to drive, often hundreds of miles at a time, just to be outdoors and in the wild.</p> <p>Far more than a year since I held a woman’s hand, felt the touch of a human body against mine. But a year since these things were even possible for me; something that could sanely be hoped for some future day. A year since it was physically possible for me to enjoy exercise, or use it as a weapon against the parasite of depression that now resides in regal ascendancy over my mind. A year since I climbed. That indescribable world of adventure, which gave my life satisfaction and meaning. The antidote to the psychological ill-health that an academic career made me otherwise so especially vulnerable to.</p> <p>A year since I woke up even just indifferent about, let alone looking forward to, the day ahead. A year since my first thought hasn’t been wishing that I had died in the night. A year since I felt more than fleeting moments of happiness. A year since I felt joy.</p> <p>A year since I died.</p> <p>A year since I was reborn into a life I never agreed to, and would never have chosen, but am condemned by others to continue. A lot can change in a year. And so perhaps, out of the darkness, comes also the light of hope.</p> <h2><strong>18 June</strong></h2> <p>Through the herculean efforts of my parents, I now have a new place to call my own. And making the adjustment has been perhaps the most difficult thing I have been through so far.</p> <p>I really didn’t think it would be this way. While nervous, before the date of the move I experienced a definite uptick in mood. This began to fade once we pulled on to the North Circular. Here was a route I had driven many times in my old life. The store where I bought furniture for my first apartment. The pet shop where I sometimes got supplies for the cats (that I no longer have). The turning I used to take to the Lea Valley to fish for pike in the winter. When I last saw these places, I was driving my own van. Now I was in the back of an ambulance, being awkwardly jolted around. Memories came flooding back punching me in the gut, reminding me how much I have lost.</p> <p>My mum came down to meet the ambulance crew and help transfer me and my possessions up into the new flat.</p> <p>One thing stopping this apartment from feeling like a home is that the walls are all bare. The answer to which would normally be obvious and easy: hang up my own pictures. But there’s the rub. Hanging any of my old artwork on the walls is almost too painful to contemplate, not least because a lot of it consists of framed pictures of mountains. Mountains <em>that</em> <em>I</em> <em>have</em> <em>climbed</em>. Even non-climbing artwork inevitably comes with memories of previous homes it has hung in; past times in my past life; friends in happier years.</p> <p>But pictures were by no means the worst of it. Also transported from my old home to my new were my old clothes. The problem is that now I can’t wear most of them. All of my old jeans, and anything with a button or a buckle, now poses the threat of pressure sores. When it comes to upper layers, anything snug against my former physique is now impossible to combine with the repulsive potbelly I permanently sport. So I agreed to help my mum triage my old clothes, deciding what to keep and what to throw away.</p> <p>I don’t think I’m exaggerating when I say this is the most painful thing I’ve ever had to do. Virtually every piece of clothing had some connection to my former life: climbing gear, bouldering gym merch, T-shirts from climbing destinations, outdoor brands – aside from the odd Guns N’ Roses T-shirt, almost every item put a dagger through my heart. Or rather, two daggers. One for myself, who died. One for climbing, the love I lost.</p> <h2><strong>7 August</strong></h2> <p>It’s been a while, and enough people have been in contact in various ways, asking if I’m all right, that I feel a quick update is in order. In the grand scheme of things, yes. On the physical side, putting aside for now that my body is a wreckage site that will only get worse with time, I’m doing OK. No further complications, with UTIs and spasms under control, for once.</p> <p>On the mental side, well… it’s a process. My occupational therapist in rehab told me that most people find the first three to six months after leaving hospital the hardest. My physical therapist said I should expect the first year to be “hell”. So far, I can’t argue with that. I’ve been able to distract myself with academic research and writing, which is certainly more than nothing. But it’s hard to feel like it’s enough.</p>    <h2><strong>25 October</strong></h2> <p>I have been watching the debate over changing the UK’s law on assisted dying with sardonic interest. On the face of it the debate should have nothing to do with me. I, after all, am not terminally ill, and what is being debated is whether people with six months or less to live should be able to die by suicide with medical help. I simply don’t meet the criteria. However, those who oppose a change in the law often claim that if the law is loosened, we will be on a slippery slope down to a place where <em>people</em> <em>like</em> <em>me </em>(disabled people) are not only offered assisted suicide, but pressed by wider society into taking that option. And as this would be bad, the law should stay as it is. On the other side, those who favour changing the law vigorously deny (at least in public) that any such slippery slope will be encountered – and thus they implicitly or explicitly agree that assisted suicide should only be for those who, to put it bluntly, are going to die soon anyway. Hence, again, it is <em>not</em> <em>for me. </em>The effect of which is to compound my overwhelming sense that I am trapped in a living nightmare from which I cannot escape.</p> <p>When medical professionals decided that my ruined body should live, whether I might have wanted it to or not, they also determined that any future choice about whether to continue would for ever be taken away from me. Whereas a normal-bodied (or even just less disabled) person could take matters into their own hands and decide that enough is enough, I cannot. I need the help of someone else. And the law is pretty clear that nobody is allowed to help me. Hence, trapped. The potential loophole here is of course to go abroad, to a jurisdiction where medically assisted suicide is legal. And so, I’m working on it. The application to Dignitas is active.</p> <h2><strong>11 November</strong></h2> <p>In ancient Greek mythology, Pandora is said to have unleashed a range of curses upon humankind. Curiosity led her to open a box entrusted to her husband, out of which death, sickness and a host of other evils escaped. But left behind, so the story goes, was hope.</p> <p>One way to read this is as a sort of consolation. That despite all the evils humanity is forced to endure, we are able to cling to the light of hope. But I’ve long suspected (both before my accident, and especially since) that hope is the worst curse of them all.</p> <p>Moral philosophers like Adam Smith would rightly point out that being in a wheelchair, with virtually useless hands, is not a permanent obstacle to mental tranquillity. Plenty of happy tetraplegics prove it to be so (and indeed, I have met some of them). If I first <em>accept</em> my situation, and allow my psychology to adjust to it, it should be possible to escape the pit of despair.</p> <p>But I am consumed by a hope that holds me back. This comes in the form of longing for medical and technological advances that somehow “cure” spinal cord injury. This is indulged by regular Google searches along those lines. Like the other night, when I went down the rabbit hole of investigating NVG-291, the leading candidate for a therapeutic treatment, now in <a href="https://nervgen.com/cto/">phase 1b/2a human trials</a>. Riding the high of hope, I convince myself that I’m only going to have to do this for a few years, and then I’m going to get my life back. But then the hope wears off, and reality hits: that even if it lives up to the most optimistic hopes, NVG-291 is only going to restore partial functions, and will anyway take years to arrive in a clinically administered setting. And even if it does arrive, I am not getting my old life back, because that life is now definitively over.</p> <p>As the saying goes, it’s the hope that kills you. My hope is a curse. I need it to die. I need to accept.</p> <p>Maybe tomorrow.</p> <ul> <li><p>Read Paul Sagar’s Substack, Diary of a Punter, <a href="https://diaryofapunter.substack.com/">here</a></p></li> </ul>'

                              title: 'The Church of England is beset by shame and division. Can it survive?'
                              content: '<p>The resignation last week of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/12/justin-welby-why-archbishop-chosen-for-his-managerial-skills-had-to-go">archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby</a>, has raised far-­reaching questions among clergy and observers about the future of the Church of England.</p> <p>“This is a crisis moment for the church,” says <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gilesfraser">Giles Fraser, an Anglican priest</a> and media theologian. “I think it’s a turning point.”</p> <p>“There needs to be a complete reset as to how this whole organisation is run at the top,” says <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/11/former-oxford-college-dean-and-senior-cleric-to-leave-church-of-england">Martyn Percy, former dean of Christ Church</a>, University of Oxford. “We need a statutory independent inquiry.”</p> <p>These reactions follow the publication of the long-delayed Makin review on how the church handled the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/11/the-guardian-view-on-abuse-and-the-church-of-england-a-reckoning-is-due-for-a-shameful-failure">allegations of sexual abuse by John Smyth</a>, a man who was an early influence on Welby. Makin made clear Welby was one of the people who had displayed a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/13/justin-welby-archbishop-resignation-church-of-england">distinct lack of curiosity</a>” about the “most prolific serial abuser to be associated with the Church of England”.</p> <p>The former chair of the Iwerne Trust – a conservative charity that ran evangelical camps where Welby was once a dormitory officer – Smyth is thought to have groomed and savagely beaten <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/13/highly-likely-john-smyth-continued-to-abuse-young-men-in-south-africa">as many as 130 boys and young men</a> in three countries across five decades. Eight boys received a total of 14,000 lashes, and two more suffered 8,000 between&nbsp;them.</p> <p>He started his sado-sexual campaign in the 1970s and by 1982, after one of his victims attempted suicide, the trust and a number of church members were aware of the allegations against him. In a familiar out-of-sight, out-of-mind move, funds were raised to send Smyth to Zimbabwe in 1984, where he would later be charged with the manslaughter of a 16-year-old boy – he was never convicted of the offence, it is thought because of his powerful connections within the Zimbabwean government.</p> <p>However appalling the Smyth case is, there is a danger whenever assessing the Church of England of crying wolf, simply because it is <em>always</em> in crisis. After all, it has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/24/church-of-england-declining-congregations-councils">losing its congregation</a> for ­decades, is stuck in an existential battle between its liberal and evangelical wings, and struggles to hold together a global communion of 85&nbsp;million Anglicans.</p> <p>Defenders of the church, including Welby himself, have pointed out that Smyth was not a clergyman and his vicious assaults on boys from Winchester College, where he took part in the school’s Christian Union, were outside the church’s jurisdiction.</p> <p>Ian Paul, an associate ­minister and member of the General Synod who writes an ­evangelical blog, <em>Psephizo</em>, says there is no comparison with the plight of the Catholic church in Ireland, where religious influence has dramatically waned after a succession of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/29/catholic-church-still-failing-to-deal-with-sexual-abuse-cases-says-vatican-report">sex and abuse scandals</a> involving priests and nuns.</p> <p>“This is not about abuse within the Church of England,” he says. “Smyth was not a minister of the Church of England.”</p> <p>This is true, but he was a lay reader who served at Christ Church Winchester, and an active part of the laity, so any attempt to distance Smyth from the church looks more like an act of self-protection than one of communal moral responsibility. And it’s not a good look for an institution that prides itself on its high ethics and benevolence to say about a monstrous abuser operating in its midst: “Nothing to do with us, guv.”</p> <p>Nonetheless, Paul does not dismiss the unprecedented significance of Welby’s resignation.</p> <p>“In 1621,” he says, “the incumbent archbishop of Canterbury actually killed somebody with a bow and arrow on a hunting trip, and even then <em>he</em> didn’t resign.”</p> <p>So something major is afoot: it’s just that the clergy can’t agree on what it is. For Paul, Welby represented an anything-goes liberalism that stood in contradiction to church doctrine, and was a poor leader. “Justin managed to make ­enemies of every single group. He made ­enemies of liberals by talking about evangelism. He made enemies of evangelicals by talking about ­sexuality. He made enemies of conservatives by talking about new forms of church.”</p> <p>The kind of change Paul would like to see – a return to established and more conservative doctrine – will be hampered, he says,&nbsp;by the bishops that Welby appointed during his 12-year tenure.</p> <p>“It’s been widely observed that the bench of bishops we now have is the weakest we’ve ever had in the history of the church,” he says. “Justin himself tried to get Paula Vennells [the disgraced former head of the Post Office] <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/feb/22/justin-welby-church-should-have-asked-more-questions-about-ex-post-office-boss">shortlisted for bishop</a> of London. That is absolutely&nbsp;catastrophic.”</p> <p>Percy, an academic specialising in ecclesiology who has been an outspoken critic of the hierarchy’s failure to listen to survivors of abuse within the church, agrees that the problem lies at the top but sees it as primarily a lack of transparency and accountability, exemplified by the issue of safeguarding.</p> <p>“It’s another serious rupture in the reservoir of trust. People just look at the church and say or intuit that this is not an institution they can trust – and it’s very hard to get that trust back,” he says.</p> <p>He describes Lambeth Palace as a self-preserving bureaucracy riven by intrigue, “including secretive organisations”, and intent on obfuscation and damage limitation.</p> <p>“I don’t think they have any perception that their secrecy and their lack of accountability, their lack of transparency and external scrutiny, is 100% the problem,” he says.</p> <p>He maintains that Smyth was not an isolated case. In 2016, he says he met a group of survivors in Oxford who told him “utterly harrowing” ­stories of abuse by figures within the church.</p> <p>The perpetrators, he says, were made known to the authorities but remained in the church and were subsequently promoted. “They’ve suffered absolutely no penalty whatsoever,” he says.</p> <p>Yet at the same time, he argues, the safeguarding measures that Welby oversaw are ill-thought-out and arbitrarily enforced, and deter the sort of volunteers on whom the church has traditionally relied for local good works.</p>    <p>Percy’s remedy is for the church to open itself up to independent assessment and break up its top-heavy bureaucracy. One aspect of this reform, he says, would be disestablishment from the British state. Ever since Henry VIII’s Act of Supremacy in 1534, the church has been part of the English and, later, British state, with the monarch as the supreme governor and ­ecclesiastical representation in the House of Lords.</p> <p> “What they need to do is get themselves back down to ground level and work out what it means to be a national church which is not an established church,” says&nbsp;Percy.</p> <p>It sounds like the continuation of the Protestant revolution that was never quite completed in the 16th century, when elements of the&nbsp;Catholic system of hierarchy were absorbed into the newly formed church.</p> <p>On balance, Fraser is against disestablishment, but he agrees that the church should scale back its global operations and focus more on the parish level.</p> <p>“Why did Welby miss all of this? It wasn’t that he was malevolent but that he was so overstretched. And there’s an ego thing going on here. They prefer to get out of the airport in Kigali with 3,000 people waving flags rather than spending a rainy afternoon in Stockport with survivors shouting at him. Who wouldn’t? But actually that’s what they’ve got to do.”</p> <p>Fraser would like to see the bishop of Chelmsford, Guli Francis-Dehqani – the “one outstanding candidate” – appointed archbishop of Canterbury, not least, he says, “because women are going to be more trusted on safeguarding than&nbsp;men”.</p> <p>While nobody expects that Welby’s resignation will arrest the long-term decline in church attendance, Paul argues that Britain is a less secular nation than is often believed. “There will be more Christians in church on a Sunday morning than people attending football matches at every level from schools up to professional,” he says.</p> <p>But a diminishing number of them are in Church of England ministries. How much this has to do with a country losing its religion, and how much it is a reflection of the church’s shrinking sociocultural relevance, is open to debate.</p> <p>What does seem clear, though, is that the church finds it hard to establish a coherent message because so much of its doctrinal teaching is subject to internal and international dispute. Nor is it adept at capitalising on wider social movements, partly for that reason.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/11/the-guardian-view-on-abuse-and-the-church-of-england-a-reckoning-is-due-for-a-shameful-failure">The Guardian view on abuse and the Church of England: a reckoning is due for a shameful failure | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One example is the rise in some quarters of what’s called “cultural Christianity”, a sort of secular appreciation of the religion’s active legacy, as well as the rituals and traditions that accompany it.</p> <p>Some critics suggest it is a movement born of anxiety about the cultural changes wrought by mass immigration, and in particular the rise of Islam.

                              title: 'Fish and chips for VE Day? Battle begins over how UK marks 80th anniversary'
                              content: '<p>People will be asked to eat fish and chips and sing I Vow To Thee My Country around a chain of beacons to mark the 80th anniversary next year of the end of the second world war.</p> <p>But the plans for 8 May, which are likely to involve the royal family and local councils, have failed to win the support of the government and the Royal British Legion, who have different – and arguably less traditional – ideas about how the day should be commemorated.</p> <p>Bruno Peek, the pageant master who has organised royal and national celebrations for more than 40 years and is behind the plans for VE Day, is frustrated that the government has distanced itself from his idea.</p> <p>“I would like the prime minister of the UK to help lead [I Vow to Thee My Country] at 9.30pm on 8 May,” Peek said. “I’m hoping that Sir Keir Starmer will stand up and sing with us.”</p> <p>The government has so far declined to commit to working with Peek or to endorse the plans for people to eat fish and chips, which is a nod to the fishermen who braved German U-boats and mines, and the farm workers who ensured that the national dish was among the few <a href="https://www.warhistoryonline.com/war-articles/fish-and-chips-british-soldier-morale.html">foodstuffs not rationed during the war</a>.</p> <p>Instead, the government and the Royal British Legion are working with other veterans’ representatives on their own, separate, £10m plans to celebrate and commemorate both VE Day, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/15/uk-to-mark-75th-anniversary-of-victory-over-japan-day">VJ (Victory over Japan) </a>Day in August.</p> <p>Peek has challenged Keir Starmer and MPs to work with him and to come out to support his plan for people to<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/aug/13/britishidentity.arts"> sing the hymn</a>, which is about love and sacrifice and derives from a poem by Sir Cecil Spring Rice, set to music by Gustav Holst.</p>    <p>“If I was Keir Starmer, I’d be on the phone to me right now, because I’ve got 43 years of experience of organising,” Peek, 73, said.</p> <p>The full details of the government and Royal British Legion’s plans have not yet been revealed but it is understood they are concerned about making remembrance more relevant to younger people and those from non-white backgrounds, as the number of armed forces families and those with direct links to the 1939-45 conflict decline.</p> <p>The legion is using VJ Day to support a campaign for a national memorial to the 2.5 million <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/27/armistice-centenary-indian-troops-testimony-sacrifice-british-library">members of the British Indian Army</a>, the biggest volunteer force in history, who served in the second world war.</p> <p>Philippa Rawlinson, the legion’s director of remembrance, wants to encourage people from Asian backgrounds to trace their own family histories of relatives who fought in the Indian Army.</p> <p>“Our challenge is that the armed forces community is getting smaller and society is changing. So we need to make sure that we are sharing stories that are relevant to wider society,” she said.</p> <p>The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) declined to say whether the prime minister and officials would endorse Peek’s chain of beacons, fish supper and hymn plans. Earlier this summer, Rishi Sunak supported Peek’s efforts to mark D-day’s 80th anniversary.</p> <p>A DCMS spokesperson said: “The 80th anniversaries of VE and VJ Days will be moments of huge significance for our country, and the government is committed to commemorating the occasions appropriately. That is why we have announced more than £10m for events. </p> <p>“We will announce the government’s plans to mark the occasion shortly.”</p> <p>Peek, who plans to retire after next year’s events, has often worked independently of government at previous national celebrations but is unimpressed. “This is why I get frustrated,” he said. “There are too many egos getting in the way.”</p> <p>“I’ve got all the parish, borough, and district councils working with me – the heartbeat of their local communities,” he said.</p> <p>He hopes that a boy and a girl, both aged eight to reflect the eight decades that have passed, will light the main beacon at the London Eye and added that his plans also reflect a multicultural Britain. “That hymn is one anyone who is proud of their country – any country – can sing, whatever their race, creed or colour,” he said.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Royal British Legion said: “I think we really need to be clear about what our plans are before we decide to work in partnership with anyone.”</p>'

In total, approximately 120 missiles and 90 drones were launched. Our air defense forces destroyed over 140 aerial targets.</p> <p>The enemy’s target was our energy infrastructure across Ukraine. Unfortunately, some facilities sustained damage from direct hits and falling debris. In Mykolaiv, a drone attack killed two people and injured six others, including two children. My deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of the victims. As of now, some areas remain without power, but all necessary forces are working to mitigate the consequences and restore the infrastructure.</p> <p>We am grateful to all our air defense units that participated in repelling this attack: anti-aircraft missile forces, our aviation – pilots of F16s, Su aircraft, and MiGs, mobile fire groups, and electronic warfare units – all worked together in an organized and coordinated manner. I thank them for their reliable protection.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div>'

                          title: 'To turn Britain around, we need a proper understanding of life for poorer workers | Torsten Bell'
                          content: '<p>Things have not being going well for low- and middle-income Britain: wages flatlining, public services crumbling and, as a result, faith in mainstream politics eroding. To start turning things around, it pays to understand the country as it exists today, not as it once was or as you imagine it to be.</p> <p>So, we should all pay attention to “Unsung Britain”, a major research project from my old Resolution Foundation colleagues, which aims to provide an audit of the circumstances and challenges of the poorer half of the working-age population. <a href="https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/unsung-britain/">Their launch report</a> already has important lessons.</p> <p>First, improving health and wealth are not separate objectives. Those on low-to-middle incomes are more than five times more likely than richer people to be out of work because of ill health. When critics say the budget’s extra money for the NHS does nothing for growth, they are missing the point.</p> <p>Second, poorer Britain <em>is</em> working. Yes, recent rising ill health has reduced employment, but the long view is that employment among low-to-middle income families is up nine percentage points since the mid-90s. There has been no rise among richer households. Contrary to many headlines, the share of poorer families in which no one is working has near halved since Tony Blair came to power (from 24% to 13%). Today, we need to improve the pay, security and volatility of people’s work.</p> <p>Third, the feeling of being squeezed is real. Half of low-to-middle income families’ spending went on essentials (like food and housing) at the start of the century. Now? In part due to higher housing costs, essentials eat up £3 out of every £5. We need to build, build, build. Our social contract hasn’t delivered for millions. It’s time to understand our country, so we can change it. </p> <p>• Torsten Bell is Labour MP for Swansea West and author of <em>Great Britain? How We Get Our Future Back</em></p>'

                          content: '<p>Our two-year-old daughter mounts the scooter. She places one unsteady foot in front of the other on its central board. An initial attempt at balance is rebuffed as gravity asserts itself and she yelps as the scooter leaves her feet, throwing her backwards. Her helmet, pink and cream, remains in place. Miraculously, there are no tears. Undaunted, our little Boudicca rights her chariot and repeats.</p> <p>We’re in our local park, giving her – and us – a crash course in resilience. It is nail-biting. We bought her the thing in the hope we’d avoid the mess we made of her brother’s tutelage. He never warmed to the various scooters and bikes we’ve inherited from his older cousins and which now languish, substantially cobwebbed, in our shed. He showed no interest in using them, and we didn’t insist, due to the fact we weren’t particularly keen on equipping him with a vehicle that could wallop him into the path of cars at 20mph and, if we’re honest, pure old-fashioned laziness.</p> <p>Now, of course, we feel stupid when we visit friends and see the joy, and speedy transport, their kids’ scooters provide. My son shows no such regrets and runs alongside these friends as they scoot, like a secret service agent escorting a presidential motorcade, evincing zero discomfort or embarrassment over this commitment to radical pedestrianism. Part of me thinks he’s just doubling down on; that he can’t possibly enjoy stretching and sweating while his friends sail effortlessly beside him. But, if that is the case and it is all an act, I can’t help but admire him more. He may not have the resilience of his sister when it comes to scooting, but his stubbornness is a marvel.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>There’s no fear or trepidation on her face at all, just the hedonic rush of motion</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From his place on terra firma, he’s whispering encouragement in her ear. She’s back onboard and planning a tentative glide. He runs beside her as she finds her speed, a bright smile spreading across her face, and his. There’s no fear or trepidation on her face at all, just the hedonic rush of motion and the joy of seeing her fears crushed like so many mulched leaves under bright pink plastic wheels.</p> <p>On the way back, she is scooting as if she’s been doing it for years, and with a cocksure swagger that suggests she occasionally gives demonstrations for cash. As we round the corner for home, we pass an older girl scooting towards us. She’s about four and clearly a local scooter pilot of great acclaim. As we pass, she gives our daughter a special acknowledgment, tapping her helmet and waving to signify that they are sisters of the board. Our girl can’t disguise her delight, and knowing not what else to say simply shouts: ‘<em>Scooter</em>!’ The other girl laughs and, as if to baptise our daughter officially into the sect, lets out a sparkling ding-ding-ding from the bell on her handlebars. We consider this, in small girl terms, roughly equivalent to a knighthood, and we turn to see how our little apprentice is taking it.<br>She’s staring, dumbfounded at the gap between her hand and the handlebars where we never thought to place a bell, motioning futile presses with her thumb.<br>‘Where’s my ding-ding-ding?’ she says, very close to tears.</p> <p><em>Follow Séamas on X </em><em><a href="https://twitter.com/shockproofbeats?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@shockproofbeats</a></em></p>'

                          title: 'Mystery surrounds 800-year-old Leicester burial pit containing 123 bodies'
                          content: '<p>In gardens a few metres from Leicester Cathedral, archaeologists have made a disturbing discovery. Their excavations have revealed a narrow vertical shaft filled with the remains of 123 men, women and children.</p> <p>It is one of the largest pit burials ever excavated in the UK, with subsequent research suggesting the bodies were dumped there more than 800 years ago, early in the 12th century.</p> <p>However, the reasons for putting the corpses in this tiny, ancient shaft remain a mystery.</p> <p>“Their bones show no signs of violence – which leaves us with two alternative reasons for these deaths: starvation or pestilence,” said Mathew Morris, project officer at Leicester University’s archaeological services. “At the moment, the latter is our main working hypothesis.”</p> <p>The excavations by Morris and his colleagues suggest the bodies were put into the shaft in three deposits, in rapid succession. “It looks as if successive cartloads of bodies were brought to the shaft and then dropped into it, one load on top of another in a very short space of time,” he said. “In terms of numbers, the people put in there probably represented about 5% of the town’s population.”</p> <p>The discovery of the mass burial provides a vivid insight into life in England more than eight centuries ago, said Morris. “Other pit burials have been found in the region but this is the biggest. Actually, just trying to find comparable pit burials anywhere in the country is proving really hard.”</p> <p>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles repeatedly mention great pestilences and fevers, severe mortality, and miserable deaths from hunger and famine in England from the mid-10th century through to the mid-12th century, said Morris. “This mass burial fits within this timeframe and provides physical proof of what was then occurring across the nation.”</p>    <p>The discovery of the mass burial is the result of a decision to build a new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/22/richard-iii-visitor-centre-leicester">heritage learning centre</a> at the cathedral. Twelve years ago, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/24/richard-iii-leicester-car-park-steve-coogan-philippa-langley-lost-king">body of Richard III </a>was found underneath a nearby car park and was subsequently buried in the cathedral, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-67090903#:~:text=%C2%A312.7m.-,The%20cathedral%20said%20visitor%20numbers%20had%20increased%20ten%2Dfold%20since,made%20the%20work%20more%20urgent.">triggering a tenfold rise in visitor numbers</a>. To cope with this influx, a new centre supported by the National Lottery Heritage Fund was approved for construction in the cathedral’s garden, a former burial ground, after a full archaeological survey had been carried out.</p> <p>This has now been completed by Morris and his colleagues. In the garden, they uncovered the remains of 1,237 men, women and children, ranging from those buried in the 19th century, down to those who were interred in the early 11th century.</p> <p>“It’s a continuous sequence of 850 years of burials from a single population from a single place, and you don’t get that very often,” added Morris. “It has generated an enormous amount of archaeology.”</p>    <p>Below these burials, the team found evidence of Anglo-Saxon dwellings and, further beneath, a Roman shrine. But most striking of all was the small vertical burial shaft that was discovered at one side of the dig: the pit burial containing the remains of 123 individuals.</p> <p>At first, the team assumed these people had died during the Black Death, the outbreak of bubonic plague that struck England in 1348 and which is thought to have killed between a third and a half of the population.</p> <p>“We initially thought this was going to be the first evidence of the Black Death arriving in Leicester,” said Morris. Then the team got the results of radiocarbon dating tests of bones from the pit. These showed that the bodies had been dumped there almost 150 years earlier, around the beginning of the 12th century.</p> <p>“That was surprising,” Morris admitted. “We have no idea, at present, what might have triggered such a massive cause of death. As far as we know, the bubonic plague did not reach our shores until 1348. So what was the cause of the mass deaths that occurred then?”</p>    <p>To find answers to this question, the Leicester team has sent samples from the bodies in the pit to geneticists at the Francis Crick Institute in London in order to search for viruses, bacteria or parasites that might have triggered the blight that struck Leicester.</p> <p>“It was clearly a devastating outbreak that resonates with recent events, in particular the Covid pandemic,” said Morris. “But it is also important to note there was still some form of civic control going on. There was still someone going around in a cart collecting bodies. What we see from studying the bodies in the pit does not indicate it was created in a&nbsp;panic.”</p> <p>He added: “There was also no evidence of clothing on any of the bodies – no buckles, brooches, nothing to suggest these were people who were dropping dead in the street before being collected and dumped.</p> <p>“In fact, there are signs that their limbs were still together, which suggests they were wrapped in shrouds. So their families were able to prepare these bodies for burial before someone from a central authority collected them to take to the pit burial.”</p>'

                            title: 'To turn Britain around, we need a proper understanding of life for poorer workers | Torsten Bell'
                            content: '<p>Things have not being going well for low- and middle-income Britain: wages flatlining, public services crumbling and, as a result, faith in mainstream politics eroding. To start turning things around, it pays to understand the country as it exists today, not as it once was or as you imagine it to be.</p> <p>So, we should all pay attention to “Unsung Britain”, a major research project from my old Resolution Foundation colleagues, which aims to provide an audit of the circumstances and challenges of the poorer half of the working-age population. <a href="https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/unsung-britain/">Their launch report</a> already has important lessons.</p> <p>First, improving health and wealth are not separate objectives. Those on low-to-middle incomes are more than five times more likely than richer people to be out of work because of ill health. When critics say the budget’s extra money for the NHS does nothing for growth, they are missing the point.</p> <p>Second, poorer Britain <em>is</em> working. Yes, recent rising ill health has reduced employment, but the long view is that employment among low-to-middle income families is up nine percentage points since the mid-90s. There has been no rise among richer households. Contrary to many headlines, the share of poorer families in which no one is working has near halved since Tony Blair came to power (from 24% to 13%). Today, we need to improve the pay, security and volatility of people’s work.</p> <p>Third, the feeling of being squeezed is real. Half of low-to-middle income families’ spending went on essentials (like food and housing) at the start of the century. Now? In part due to higher housing costs, essentials eat up £3 out of every £5. We need to build, build, build. Our social contract hasn’t delivered for millions. It’s time to understand our country, so we can change it. </p> <p>• Torsten Bell is Labour MP for Swansea West and author of <em>Great Britain? How We Get Our Future Back</em></p>'

                            content: '<p>Our two-year-old daughter mounts the scooter. She places one unsteady foot in front of the other on its central board. An initial attempt at balance is rebuffed as gravity asserts itself and she yelps as the scooter leaves her feet, throwing her backwards. Her helmet, pink and cream, remains in place. Miraculously, there are no tears. Undaunted, our little Boudicca rights her chariot and repeats.</p> <p>We’re in our local park, giving her – and us – a crash course in resilience. It is nail-biting. We bought her the thing in the hope we’d avoid the mess we made of her brother’s tutelage. He never warmed to the various scooters and bikes we’ve inherited from his older cousins and which now languish, substantially cobwebbed, in our shed. He showed no interest in using them, and we didn’t insist, due to the fact we weren’t particularly keen on equipping him with a vehicle that could wallop him into the path of cars at 20mph and, if we’re honest, pure old-fashioned laziness.</p> <p>Now, of course, we feel stupid when we visit friends and see the joy, and speedy transport, their kids’ scooters provide. My son shows no such regrets and runs alongside these friends as they scoot, like a secret service agent escorting a presidential motorcade, evincing zero discomfort or embarrassment over this commitment to radical pedestrianism. Part of me thinks he’s just doubling down on; that he can’t possibly enjoy stretching and sweating while his friends sail effortlessly beside him. But, if that is the case and it is all an act, I can’t help but admire him more. He may not have the resilience of his sister when it comes to scooting, but his stubbornness is a marvel.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>There’s no fear or trepidation on her face at all, just the hedonic rush of motion</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From his place on terra firma, he’s whispering encouragement in her ear. She’s back onboard and planning a tentative glide. He runs beside her as she finds her speed, a bright smile spreading across her face, and his. There’s no fear or trepidation on her face at all, just the hedonic rush of motion and the joy of seeing her fears crushed like so many mulched leaves under bright pink plastic wheels.</p> <p>On the way back, she is scooting as if she’s been doing it for years, and with a cocksure swagger that suggests she occasionally gives demonstrations for cash. As we round the corner for home, we pass an older girl scooting towards us. She’s about four and clearly a local scooter pilot of great acclaim. As we pass, she gives our daughter a special acknowledgment, tapping her helmet and waving to signify that they are sisters of the board. Our girl can’t disguise her delight, and knowing not what else to say simply shouts: ‘<em>Scooter</em>!’ The other girl laughs and, as if to baptise our daughter officially into the sect, lets out a sparkling ding-ding-ding from the bell on her handlebars. We consider this, in small girl terms, roughly equivalent to a knighthood, and we turn to see how our little apprentice is taking it.<br>She’s staring, dumbfounded at the gap between her hand and the handlebars where we never thought to place a bell, motioning futile presses with her thumb.<br>‘Where’s my ding-ding-ding?’ she says, very close to tears.</p> <p><em>Follow Séamas on X </em><em><a href="https://twitter.com/shockproofbeats?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@shockproofbeats</a></em></p>'

                            title: 'Mystery surrounds 800-year-old Leicester burial pit containing 123 bodies'
                            content: '<p>In gardens a few metres from Leicester Cathedral, archaeologists have made a disturbing discovery. Their excavations have revealed a narrow vertical shaft filled with the remains of 123 men, women and children.</p> <p>It is one of the largest pit burials ever excavated in the UK, with subsequent research suggesting the bodies were dumped there more than 800 years ago, early in the 12th century.</p> <p>However, the reasons for putting the corpses in this tiny, ancient shaft remain a mystery.</p> <p>“Their bones show no signs of violence – which leaves us with two alternative reasons for these deaths: starvation or pestilence,” said Mathew Morris, project officer at Leicester University’s archaeological services. “At the moment, the latter is our main working hypothesis.”</p> <p>The excavations by Morris and his colleagues suggest the bodies were put into the shaft in three deposits, in rapid succession. “It looks as if successive cartloads of bodies were brought to the shaft and then dropped into it, one load on top of another in a very short space of time,” he said. “In terms of numbers, the people put in there probably represented about 5% of the town’s population.”</p> <p>The discovery of the mass burial provides a vivid insight into life in England more than eight centuries ago, said Morris. “Other pit burials have been found in the region but this is the biggest. Actually, just trying to find comparable pit burials anywhere in the country is proving really hard.”</p> <p>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles repeatedly mention great pestilences and fevers, severe mortality, and miserable deaths from hunger and famine in England from the mid-10th century through to the mid-12th century, said Morris. “This mass burial fits within this timeframe and provides physical proof of what was then occurring across the nation.”</p>    <p>The discovery of the mass burial is the result of a decision to build a new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/22/richard-iii-visitor-centre-leicester">heritage learning centre</a> at the cathedral. Twelve years ago, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/24/richard-iii-leicester-car-park-steve-coogan-philippa-langley-lost-king">body of Richard III </a>was found underneath a nearby car park and was subsequently buried in the cathedral, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-67090903#:~:text=%C2%A312.7m.-,The%20cathedral%20said%20visitor%20numbers%20had%20increased%20ten%2Dfold%20since,made%20the%20work%20more%20urgent.">triggering a tenfold rise in visitor numbers</a>. To cope with this influx, a new centre supported by the National Lottery Heritage Fund was approved for construction in the cathedral’s garden, a former burial ground, after a full archaeological survey had been carried out.</p> <p>This has now been completed by Morris and his colleagues. In the garden, they uncovered the remains of 1,237 men, women and children, ranging from those buried in the 19th century, down to those who were interred in the early 11th century.</p> <p>“It’s a continuous sequence of 850 years of burials from a single population from a single place, and you don’t get that very often,” added Morris. “It has generated an enormous amount of archaeology.”</p>    <p>Below these burials, the team found evidence of Anglo-Saxon dwellings and, further beneath, a Roman shrine. But most striking of all was the small vertical burial shaft that was discovered at one side of the dig: the pit burial containing the remains of 123 individuals.</p> <p>At first, the team assumed these people had died during the Black Death, the outbreak of bubonic plague that struck England in 1348 and which is thought to have killed between a third and a half of the population.</p> <p>“We initially thought this was going to be the first evidence of the Black Death arriving in Leicester,” said Morris. Then the team got the results of radiocarbon dating tests of bones from the pit. These showed that the bodies had been dumped there almost 150 years earlier, around the beginning of the 12th century.</p> <p>“That was surprising,” Morris admitted. “We have no idea, at present, what might have triggered such a massive cause of death. As far as we know, the bubonic plague did not reach our shores until 1348. So what was the cause of the mass deaths that occurred then?”</p>    <p>To find answers to this question, the Leicester team has sent samples from the bodies in the pit to geneticists at the Francis Crick Institute in London in order to search for viruses, bacteria or parasites that might have triggered the blight that struck Leicester.</p> <p>“It was clearly a devastating outbreak that resonates with recent events, in particular the Covid pandemic,” said Morris. “But it is also important to note there was still some form of civic control going on. There was still someone going around in a cart collecting bodies. What we see from studying the bodies in the pit does not indicate it was created in a&nbsp;panic.”</p> <p>He added: “There was also no evidence of clothing on any of the bodies – no buckles, brooches, nothing to suggest these were people who were dropping dead in the street before being collected and dumped.</p> <p>“In fact, there are signs that their limbs were still together, which suggests they were wrapped in shrouds. So their families were able to prepare these bodies for burial before someone from a central authority collected them to take to the pit burial.”</p>'

                          title: 'UK aid budget to Sudan set to double amid famine fears'
                          content: '<p>Ministers have announced a doubling of aid to Sudan in response to deepening concern that the country is heading towards a famine worse than the one witnessed in Ethiopia 40 years ago.</p> <p>Assistance worth £113m has been agreed for the war-torn state and neighbouring countries amid fears that Sudan’s death toll through starvation could ultimately exceed the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/30/sudan-on-precipice-of-famine-beyond-imagination-says-outgoing-un-aid-chief">Ethiopian famine</a> that, according to UN estimates, caused a million deaths between 1983 and 1985. A ruinous <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/mar/22/what-caused-the-civil-war-in-sudan-and-how-has-it-become-one-of-the-worlds-worst-humanitarian-crises">civil war</a> between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has seen starvation repeatedly used as a weapon, with aid deliveries blocked by both sides.</p> <p>The £113m package means Sudan will be among the highest recipients of UK bilateral foreign aid. It reflects its status as not only the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/aug/27/sudan-needs-an-exceptional-humanitarian-endeavour-to-end-its-horrific-civil-war">worst humanitarian crisis</a> in the world – but one that is becoming a humanitarian catastrophe of historic proportions. Sudan will be receiving roughly the same as Afghanistan did last year, though critics will point out the amount is still less than half what the UK gave Ukraine. Tomorrow the UK will push a draft UN security council resolution calling for the protection of civilians and unrestricted passage of aid in Sudan.</p> <p>During a visit to the UN security council in New York, foreign secretary David Lammy will urge the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) to keep the critical Adré border crossing with Chad open indefinitely and for the removal of restrictions that have curtailed the amount of aid passing through.</p> <p>“We cannot deliver aid without access. Starvation must not be used as a weapon of war and we can only stop this famine if every border crossing and route is open, accessible and safe,” said Lammy. UK officials hope the increased aid will support more than a million people affected by Sudan’s catastrophic conflict.</p> <p>Alarm is intensifying, however, over the ramifications of the ongoing fighting in el-Gezira state, Sudan’s agricultural heartland, which could dramatically limit food supplies.</p> <p>If no significant improvements materialise to boost the supply of food and humanitarian help, officials fear that Sudan’s death toll could end up running into the millions.</p> <p>On Friday a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/14/sudan-war-death-toll-much-higher-than-previously-recorded-new-study-finds">study</a> found that the death toll from Sudan’s civil war is already much higher than previously reported. Of more than 61,000 people who have died in Khartoum, researchers found that only 26,000 were killed through violence, with the leading cause of death across Sudan identified as preventable disease and starvation.</p> <p>Evidence also emerged last week that hundreds may have died in a cholera outbreak in the besieged town of al-Hilaliya in el-Gezira state. The RSF surrounded the town last month, home to tens of thousands of locals and displaced people.</p> <p>Despite the scale of the crisis facing Sudan, UN agencies <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157001">recently reiterated</a> the urgent need for additional funding. Currently the UN’s £2.14bn Sudan humanitarian appeal is only 57% funded, posing “significant challenges” to sustaining necessary relief efforts. More than 500,000 people in Darfur, west Sudan, are in famine conditions which is likely to spread. Throughout the country, 25 million are reliant on aid.</p>'

In betweeen all that, McCoy beats Salt twice.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6738f99a8f08462ddd0c660d" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-11-16T19:59:48.341Z">7.59pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>The players are out</strong> – let’s see what West Indies can do in the power play. </p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6738f77e8f08916386e2377f" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-11-16T19:57:25.925Z">7.57pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Pitch report</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>We get up close and personal</strong> with the St Lucia pitch alongside Carlos Brathwaite.

                          title: 'Trend watch: get ready for a country weekend'
                          content: '<p>Fashion’s longstanding love of heritage and dressing up in the style of those attending country-house weekends has dominated the runways this season, from Chloé’s cape silhouette plaid coat to Wales Bonner’s check barn jacket styled over a dark tweed two piece. Meanwhile labels such as Margaret Howell and Stefan Cooke have adopted hardwearing tweed, styled with denim or paired with a knit, and heavy-duty wool trousers in a palette of autumn hues, from mustard, olive green and russet to rich chestnut brown. It’s a look suitable for long walks in the countryside, with textured wool coats layered over quilted and canvas barn jackets, such as Mango’s contrasting collar version (6, below) or Sezane’s flap pocket design in camel, £285.</p> <p>Knitwear is the foundation to this look, an argyle cardigan or jumper that’s reminiscent of Brideshead Revisited, the Mitford sisters and off-duty royals at Balmoral. The argyle knit is a great entry-point to this trend, and &amp;Daughter’s Ava sweater (£395), made in Hawick, Scotland, is the real deal, made with responsible Wool Standard-certified wool. On the high street, M&amp;S (10) has a simplified graphic take on the design (£35). There are also plenty of pre-loved iterations to be found, for example at Beyond Retro and eBay. For day, keep things practical with flat boots: Whistles lugsole knee-high pair (£259) have an equestrian vibe that works for the trend. Alternatively, Blundstone’s ankle boots (£190) come in a variety of colours and weather-appropriate finishes. Mixing textures and pattern is key, try checks with wool and throw in some embellishment to stay on the right side of cosplay.</p> <p>It’s not just weekend walks attire either. Essentiel Antwerp’s checked mesh-covered midi skirt with silver palm-tree embroidery (£240) works for Christmas parties worn with a silk shirt and heels, while Gant’s pleated grey check skirt with red trim (£150) looks great with a cashmere sweater and crystal earrings. </p> <h2><strong>Mini kilt</strong></h2>    <p>£375, <a href="https://lekilt.co.uk/products/micro-mini-kilt-2">lekilt.co.uk</a></p> <h2><strong>Cardigan</strong></h2>    <p>£45.99, <a href="https://www.zara.com/uk/en/argyle-knit-cardigan-p00021124.html">zara.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Tote</strong></h2>    <p>£140,<a href="https://www.jwanderson.com/gb/shopping/canvas-tote-hedgehog-print-24264134?srsltid=AfmBOoqITFe_kez4LMvhi6AQVwnRVQ2lLUxCLXnql1EJqu-Kzu3DgFNJ"> jwanderson.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Socks</strong></h2>    <p>£14, <a href="https://www.burlington.de/uk_en/p/queen-women-socks/22004_8011/">burlington.de</a></p> <h2><strong>Loafers</strong></h2>    <p>£249, <a href="https://penelopechilvers.com/products/high-lorenzo-leather-loafer?">penelopechilver. co.uk</a></p> <h2><strong>Barn jacket</strong></h2>    <p>£99.99, <a href="https://shop.mango.com/gb/en/p/women/jackets/parka-with-contrasting-collar-and-pockets_77078264?c=37">mango.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Shirt</strong></h2>    <p>£140, <a href="https://www.withnothingunderneath.com/products/alexander-tencel-chocolate-stripe-x-felicity-kay">withnothingunderneath.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Knee high boots</strong></h2>    <p>£160.00, <a href="https://www.clarks.com/en-gb/orinoco-2-tall/26179097-p">clarks.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Skirt</strong></h2>    <p>£150, <a href="https://www.gant.co.uk/check-print-pleated-skirt-evening-blue/7325707733574.html?">gant.co.uk</a></p> <h2><strong>Jumper</strong></h2>    <p>£35, <a href="https://www.marksandspencer.com/argyle-crew-neck-jumper-with-wool/p/clp60688334">marksandspencer.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Chunky boot</strong></h2>    <p>£195, <a href="https://www.whistles.com/product/hatton-chunky-chelsea-boot-35481.html#suggestion=true">whistles.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Socks</strong></h2>    <p>£20 <a href="https://www.pantherella.com/harlow?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAoae5BhCNARIsADVLzZe3Sk39tAwn4EyJCMaTVMMK47RV2sRmJRy4okX24o2KmPqcRt_Sq1YaAgQoEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds#151=188">pantherella.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Argyle wool vest</strong></h2>    <p>£95, <a href="https://cos.com/en_gbp/women/womenswear/knitwear/product.argyle-wool-vest-grey.1247977001.html?">cos.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Midi skirt</strong></h2>    <p>£89.95, <a href="https://www.massimodutti.com/gb/flounce-midi-skirt-l05288288?srsltid=AfmBOopLgAEULoNdFhmHRe9I5oXnfEJ8UHCxd9SNmGyHVyClTcHGQdx2">massimodutti.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Blazer</strong></h2>    <p>£79.99, <a href="https://shop.mango.com/gb/en/p/women/blazers/houndstooth-checked-blazer_77068271">mango.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Boots</strong></h2>    <p>£110.00, Tretorn <a href="https://www.toa.st/collections/womens-footwear/products/tretorn-terrang-winter-boots-brown-olive">toa.st</a></p> <h2><strong>Embellished skirt</strong></h2>    <p><strong>£240, </strong><a href="https://www.essentiel-antwerp.com/uk/p/green-skirt-greyhound">essentiel-antwerp.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Earrings</strong></h2>    <p><strong>£65, </strong><a href="https://www.essentiel-antwerp.com/uk/p/silver-earrings-gardia">essentiel-antwerp.com</a></p>'

                          content: '<p><strong>Wolf Hall: The Mirror </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>the Light</strong> (BBC One) | <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0024z1n/wolf-hall-the-mirror-and-the-light-1-wreckage">iPlayer</a><br><strong>Bad Sisters</strong> (<a href="https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/bad-sisters/umc.cmc.14kr4vv65unannh7doqgvlh20">Apple TV+</a>)<br><strong>Immigration: How British Politics Failed</strong> (BBC Two) | <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0024qb1/immigration-how-british-politics-failed-series-1-episode-1">iPlayer</a><br><strong>The Penguin</strong> (<a href="https://www.sky.com/watch/the-penguin">Sky Atlantic</a>/ <a href="https://www.nowtv.com/watch/the-penguin/iYEQZ2rcf32Y5xEUtq4wdY/iYsxVQTYrUBMYhe8hJKH8f/seasons/1">Now</a>)</p> <p>I ’m a huge fan of Hilary Mantel’s double Booker prize-winning <em>Wolf Hall</em> trilogy, and was frustrated and unimpressed by BBC Two’s 2015 dramatisation of the first two novels, <em>Wolf Hall</em> and <em>Bring Up </em><em>the Bodies</em>. Starring Mark Rylance as Henry VIII’s lowborn fixer, Thomas Cromwell, director Peter Kosminsky’s Bafta-winning adaptation felt as sluggish and laboured as Mantel’s writing was vivid and exciting. The series did ignite about two-thirds in, as Anne Boleyn (played with raw magnificence by Claire Foy) succumbed to trumped-up charges of treason, culminating in the unbearable, wind-lashed scenes of her beheading.</p> <p>Almost a decade later we’re plunged back into those terrible final moments in the opening episode of <strong><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0024z1n/wolf-hall-the-mirror-and-the-light-1-wreckage">Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light</a></strong>, based on Mantel’s concluding novel and again directed by Kosminsky and written by Peter Straughan. Here, Anne’s execution is intercut with Henry preparing for marriage to Jane Seymour (Kate Phillips) – the all-time king of toxic masculinity shrugging on weighty regalia and getting his beard trimmed in his latest bid for a legitimate male heir.</p> <p>“Such freshness, such delicacy,” he purrs of his wedding night to a guilt-ridden but carefully impassive Cromwell, who is rewarded by being made Lord Privy Seal. Alone, Cromwell is frequently visited by the ghost of his former master and true significant other, Cardinal Wolsey (Jonathan Pryce), who will soon remind him of Henry’s lethal caprice: “When fortune turns against you, you will feel the lash.”</p> <p>I suppose spoilers don’t count here; history contains all of those. Bar a few stodgy lulls, from the two episodes (of six) I’ve seen, this second series crackles with tension, driving forward the busy plot points: succession, ambition, peril, absolutism, religious turmoil, omnipresent female powerlessness and fear.</p> <p>Cromwell now seems much more akin to the self-possessed but uncompromising attack dog of the books. It also helps enormously to be able to see what’s happening; at times, the first series looked as if it had been filmed inside a candlelit Tudor duvet cover. Cast changes, such as Timothy Spall replacing the late Bernard Hill as the Duke of Norfolk, work well, while Lilit Lesser is dynamite as Catherine of Aragon’s daughter, Lady Mary.</p>    <p>Then there’s Damian Lewis. The role of Henry is tricky: easy to collapse into cosplay caricature. It doesn’t matter (to me, anyway) that the actor doesn’t look as if he reeks of Henry’s regal gout; it matters that he’s impulsive, mercurial, spoiled, shallow and petrifying, whether being applauded at masked balls by lickspittles or silkily glaring at Cromwell as, finally, the blacksmith’s son blunders into a huge mistake. Lewis is outstanding throughout.</p> <p>I was concerned about the second series of the jet-black comedy <strong><a href="https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/bad-sisters/umc.cmc.14kr4vv65unannh7doqgvlh20">Bad Sisters</a></strong> (Apple TV+). Could it be as compelling without Claes Bang as swaggering smoothie baddie John Paul, who was – spoiler klaxon – offed, after many demented attempts by the bickering Garvey sisters, trying to protect their sibling (his wife) Grace (Anne-Marie Duff). While the original <em>Bad Sisters</em> – adapted by Sharon Horgan, Dave Finkel and Brett Bauer from the Flemish series <em>Clan</em> – was meant as a standalone story, in season two, Horgan creates a new mystery and also writes some episodes.</p> <p>Early blissful scenes of Grace emerging, butterfly-like, from long-term abuse to marry new love Ian (Owen McDonnell) soon give way to the discovery of a corpse, chaos, desperation, police questioning, terrible tragedy and more for her sisters – played by Horgan (bossy Eva, who has a “menopause coach”), Eve Hewson (chaotic Becka, who performs a “nervous wee”), Eva Birthistle (perma-stressed medic Ursula) and Sarah Greene (foxy, eyepatch-sporting Bibi).</p>    <p>The plot becomes a little mangled, and while there are funny lines (“I love incense: it’s how I imagine Jesus smelled”), there are fewer than in the first series. That said, the ensemble playing remains pitch-perfect, and sweetly desperate neighbour Roger (Michael Smiley) is given a malevolent nosy churchwoman sister, Angelica, played with witchy naughtiness by Fiona Shaw. Yes, the suave horror of John Paul is missed, but over the course of eight episodes there’s still much to savour.</p> <p>New two-part BBC Two docuseries <strong><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0024qb1/immigration-how-british-politics-failed-series-1-episode-1">Immigration: How British Politics Failed</a></strong> is to be commended for tackling such a difficult subject, but it also proves the impossibility of having a coherent, intelligent national debate on the matter.</p> <p>Winding back to the early 00s, it’s interesting. Tony Blair talks about the migrant argument for economic growth. There’s an in-depth breakdown of major decisions and mistakes. There’s also a broad range of interviewees, including Andrew Green, whose Migration Watch thinktank produced data and analysis that David Cameron says proved “helpful” to the Conservatives.</p> <p>Unfortunately, every so often Nigel Farage bursts in, doing his Brexit panto routine. Early on he blares: “At least Tony Blair was honest. He said: We’re going to open the doors to the whole world.” (Yawn! Blair didn’t say that.) In next week’s episode, Farage says with ill-disguised relish: “Just you watch, this issue is going to get bigger and bigger.”</p> <p>Is his rather predictable input needed in all such documentaries? Couldn’t there just be a blank screen saying: “Please insert your own Nigel Farage bit here”? I’m not suggesting banning him (perish the thought!) – just giving him a wee rest on the topic of immigration. We can all agree he’s earned it.</p> <p>On Sky Atlantic, Lauren LeFranc’s <strong><a href="https://www.sky.com/watch/the-penguin">The Penguin</a></strong>, an eight-part TV-spin-off from 2022 film <em>The Batman</em>, concluded with the visceral virtuosity that, despite occasional slides into cheesy franchisedom, has made this the year’s most unexpected triumph. I won’t disclose the jaw-dropping and devastating late twist. I can reveal (lesser spoiler alert) that in the closing seconds, a bat logo appears in the sky above Gotham.</p>    <p>One of <em>The Penguin</em>’s secrets has been its committed story arc: it didn’t act like it had umpteen series to make a point. Nor was Oswald “Penguin” Cobb (Colin Farrell)<strong> </strong>played as a joke, but as an intimidating mobster, a charismatic leader, who wears his ugliness on the inside yet still has some to spare on the outside. Farrell’s achievement is that you forget he’s larded in a veritable acreage of prosthetics. You just remember his performance, and it’s staggering.</p> <p><em>Star ratings (out of five)<br>Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light</em> <strong>★★★★</strong><br><em>Bad Sisters</em> <strong>★★★★</strong><br><em>Immigration: How British Politics Failed</em> <strong>★★★</strong><br><em>The Penguin</em> <strong>★★★★</strong></p> <h2>What else I’m watching</h2> <p><strong><a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81685880">Sprint</a><br></strong>(Netflix)<br>The return of the fascinating fly-on-the-wall documentary about international sprinters – among them the irrepressible US champion Noah Lyles.

                          content: '<p>Our two-year-old daughter mounts the scooter. She places one unsteady foot in front of the other on its central board. An initial attempt at balance is rebuffed as gravity asserts itself and she yelps as the scooter leaves her feet, throwing her backwards. Her helmet, pink and cream, remains in place. Miraculously, there are no tears. Undaunted, our little Boudicca rights her chariot and repeats.</p> <p>We’re in our local park, giving her – and us – a crash course in resilience. It is nail-biting. We bought her the thing in the hope we’d avoid the mess we made of her brother’s tutelage. He never warmed to the various scooters and bikes we’ve inherited from his older cousins and which now languish, substantially cobwebbed, in our shed. He showed no interest in using them, and we didn’t insist, due to the fact we weren’t particularly keen on equipping him with a vehicle that could wallop him into the path of cars at 20mph and, if we’re honest, pure old-fashioned laziness.</p> <p>Now, of course, we feel stupid when we visit friends and see the joy, and speedy transport, their kids’ scooters provide. My son shows no such regrets and runs alongside these friends as they scoot, like a secret service agent escorting a presidential motorcade, evincing zero discomfort or embarrassment over this commitment to radical pedestrianism. Part of me thinks he’s just doubling down on; that he can’t possibly enjoy stretching and sweating while his friends sail effortlessly beside him. But, if that is the case and it is all an act, I can’t help but admire him more. He may not have the resilience of his sister when it comes to scooting, but his stubbornness is a marvel.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>There’s no fear or trepidation on her face at all, just the hedonic rush of motion</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From his place on terra firma, he’s whispering encouragement in her ear. She’s back onboard and planning a tentative glide. He runs beside her as she finds her speed, a bright smile spreading across her face, and his. There’s no fear or trepidation on her face at all, just the hedonic rush of motion and the joy of seeing her fears crushed like so many mulched leaves under bright pink plastic wheels.</p> <p>On the way back, she is scooting as if she’s been doing it for years, and with a cocksure swagger that suggests she occasionally gives demonstrations for cash. As we round the corner for home, we pass an older girl scooting towards us. She’s about four and clearly a local scooter pilot of great acclaim. As we pass, she gives our daughter a special acknowledgment, tapping her helmet and waving to signify that they are sisters of the board. Our girl can’t disguise her delight, and knowing not what else to say simply shouts: ‘<em>Scooter</em>!’ The other girl laughs and, as if to baptise our daughter officially into the sect, lets out a sparkling ding-ding-ding from the bell on her handlebars. We consider this, in small girl terms, roughly equivalent to a knighthood, and we turn to see how our little apprentice is taking it.<br>She’s staring, dumbfounded at the gap between her hand and the handlebars where we never thought to place a bell, motioning futile presses with her thumb.<br>‘Where’s my ding-ding-ding?’ she says, very close to tears.</p> <p><em>Follow Séamas on X </em><em><a href="https://twitter.com/shockproofbeats?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@shockproofbeats</a></em></p>'

He remains best known as a novelist, garnering laurels including the International Dublin literary award and the David Cohen prize for literature, and being praised for his sheer range as well as a near-magical ability to capture all that goes unsaid in life. His greatest commercial success to date is <em>Brooklyn </em>(2009), which follows Eilis Lacey as she leaves her home town – and Tóibín’s own – of Enniscorthy, County Wexford, for greater opportunities in the US. It later became a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/08/brooklyn-observer-film-review-saoirse-ronan">film starring Saoirse Ronan</a>. His 11th novel, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/may/19/long-island-by-colm-toibin-review-sequel-to-breakthrough-brooklyn#:~:text=Long%20Island%20often%20reads%20like,but%20is%20a%20vivid%20highlight.">Long Island</a></em>, is the sequel he swore he’d never write, catching up with Eilis two decades on. Tóibín divides his time between Los Angeles and New York City, where he teaches English literature at Columbia University.</p> <p><em><strong>Long Island</strong></em><strong> is on the shortlist for Waterstones </strong><strong>book of the </strong><strong>year, which must be nice…<br></strong>It cheers you up. You work tentatively as a writer – you think this might work and that might work but you’re trying things. This is one of the ways where you feel that maybe you got something right.</p> <p><strong>You’re not a fan of sequels. Have you changed your opinion in light of </strong><em><strong>Long Island</strong></em><strong>’s reception?<br></strong>I haven’t. The idea that a novel would have a sequel, that the ending is merely provisional, I think really makes a difference to the experience of reading the book. A novel is not a line, it doesn’t just chug along like a train. It is an actual arc, and you have to have a real sense of that as a reader. </p> <p><strong>So why did you make an exception?<br></strong><em>Long Island</em> is set 20 years later and has an entirely different structure to <em>Brooklyn</em>. It moves only according to the rules of plot, so it is a different book in that sense.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>I do get homesick, yes. It’s the music that gets me. My partner will say: ''Oh my God, he’s putting on the music…''</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Did returning to characters you first conjured into being in 2009 make you aware of changes in yourself as a writer? <br></strong>I saw the film [<em>Brooklyn</em>] a good lot. Normally, in film and novels, Irishmen are unreliable, charming, brooding. It makes making an Irishman who’s quiet and stable particularly difficult. Jim in <em>Brooklyn</em> is a very nice fellow but he’s not the point of the book. The actor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/jul/31/on-my-radar-domhnall-gleeson-cultural-highlights">Domhnall Gleeson</a> managed to give him a sort of glow, a strange power that came from his quietness. I saw a new way his character could be done, so Jim in <em>Long Island</em> derived partly from my watching of the film. I can’t find a precedent for it, where a novelist gets a gift like that.</p> <p><strong>Do you continue to think of Ireland as home, and if so, do you get homesick? <br></strong>Yes. It’s the music that gets me. My partner will say: “Oh my God, he’s putting on the music…” I could on a given night, for no reason, find myself listening to some song, like Kevin Burke and Micheál Ó Domhnaill’s Lord Franklin, and then I’ll put on another… It’s like being a drunken Irishman, except I don’t drink any more.</p>    <p><strong>How often do you go back to Enniscorthy? <br></strong>I’ve just been there now because the opera I wrote the libretto for, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/26/the-week-in-classical-wexford-festival-opera-le-convenienze-ed-inconvenienze-teatrali-donizetti-the-critic-stanford-le-maschere-mascagni-lady-gregory-in-america-colm-toibin-alberto-caruso-review">Lady Gregory in America</a></em>, was on at Wexford Festival Opera. I like to think of it as the people’s opera – it was on at 11 in the morning and it only cost €25 [£21] to go to. A lot of local people booked and there was a nice feeling. I’ll be back for Christmas.</p> <p><strong>Ireland today is very different </strong><strong>from the country you grew up in and left in the 1970s. For starters, it’s a lot easier to be gay… <br></strong>It’s a much freer place. The gay thing was odd and unexpected because it was a conservative movement. It was families saying we want our families to be strengthened by the presence of our gay son, and the gay son saying I want my own family. It was the two words that the church had taken from us that we took back: family and love.</p> <p><strong>As a teenager, you thought seriously about becoming a priest. Do you have any residual faith? <br></strong>Oh, residual – I’m <em>all</em> residual! But no, I’m an atheist.</p> <p><strong>You underwent treatment for aggressive cancer in 2018. Were you tempted to try to revive your religious beliefs? <br></strong>It never arose. It was a very secular time – dosage, different medicines, sleep. There wasn’t a spiritual moment.</p> <p><strong>LA seems an unlikely place for you to have landed. There’s a perception that it’s unintellectual</strong><strong> – somehow “lite”… <br></strong>None of that’s true. The only thing you can’t do here is flaneur around. You really live in your back yard and your life depends on the quality of your back yard, where the sun falls and where the shadows fall, and where the pomegranate tree is and where the passion fruit vine is. It’s a funny thing if you’re Irish to talk about – not where the potatoes and the cabbages are.</p> <p><strong>We should probably talk about Donald Trump. Were you shocked by the US election result?<br></strong>I was. It’s a disaster – it sets everything back. There’s no area in which Trump’s presence in America is in any way helpful, and there’s something grotesque about the people around him. I’ve utter contempt for Mitch McConnell [the outgoing Senate minority leader and staunch Trump ally].</p> <p><strong>Do you think his presidency will have a draining effect on the nation’s creative industries, as energies are focused on activism? <br></strong>The thing to do is to close the door and get on with making books. It’s what WB Yeats said about the funeral of Parnell in Ireland in 1891 – now, after politics has utterly failed us, the imagination can come to the fore. It would have been better were it the other way around.</p> <p><strong>What are your thoughts on turning 70 next year?<br></strong>It’s <em>very</em> old. There’s nothing else to be said.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Long Island </em>is published by Picador (£20)<em>. </em>To support the <em>Guardian</em> and <em>Observer</em> order your copy at<a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/long-island-9781035029440/"> guardianbookshop.com</a>.

That’s a sign of how seriously we take this relationship, which is a relationship between our peoples based upon our common values.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/15/former-ambassador-to-washington-accuses-sky-news-australia-of-personal-and-political-campaign-against-kevin-rudd-ntwnfb">Former ambassador to US accuses unnamed Sky News Australia presenters of campaign against Kevin Rudd</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Albanese declined to say whether Rudd should apologise for past remarks, which included social media posts calling him “the most destructive president in history” and a 2021 interview in which he described Trump in a 2021 interview as “the village idiot” and “not a leading intellectual force”.</p> <p>“We’re focused on the future, and I’m sure President Trump will be as well, and that is the important thing,” Albanese said.</p> <p>The emergence last week of video of the 2021 remarks this week coincided with a social media post from Trump’s now newly appointed deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino depicting sand running through an hourglass, above a screenshot of the congratulatory message Rudd had issued about Trump’s election win.</p> <p>But Albanese said Rudd has been doing “a terrific job” and will continue in the role.</p> <p>He praised the former prime minister’s work building bipartisan relationships and boosting Australia’s ties in the US capital.</p> <p>“Ambassador, Rudd has been working with people across the political spectrum. He attended both the Republican and the Democrat national conventions and engaged with people across the board. I know that he was in regular contact with the head of the Republican campaign committee as well, as well as the Democrats.”</p> <p>In a separate interview with Sky News, also from Peru, Albanese said his 10-minute congratulatory phone conversation with Trump had been “very constructive and positive” and Rudd was not mentioned.</p> <p>“He’s Australia’s ambassador to Washington, and he’s doing a very important job,” Albanese said. “The work that he did with Aukus was a difficult task to get that through the Congress and the Senate.

                            content: '<p>Ministers have announced a doubling of aid to Sudan in response to deepening concern that the country is heading towards a famine worse than the one witnessed in Ethiopia 40 years ago.</p> <p>Assistance worth £113m has been agreed for the war-torn state and neighbouring countries amid fears that Sudan’s death toll through starvation could ultimately exceed the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/30/sudan-on-precipice-of-famine-beyond-imagination-says-outgoing-un-aid-chief">Ethiopian famine</a> that, according to UN estimates, caused a million deaths between 1983 and 1985. A ruinous <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/mar/22/what-caused-the-civil-war-in-sudan-and-how-has-it-become-one-of-the-worlds-worst-humanitarian-crises">civil war</a> between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has seen starvation repeatedly used as a weapon, with aid deliveries blocked by both sides.</p> <p>The £113m package means Sudan will be among the highest recipients of UK bilateral foreign aid. It reflects its status as not only the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/aug/27/sudan-needs-an-exceptional-humanitarian-endeavour-to-end-its-horrific-civil-war">worst humanitarian crisis</a> in the world – but one that is becoming a humanitarian catastrophe of historic proportions. Sudan will be receiving roughly the same as Afghanistan did last year, though critics will point out the amount is still less than half what the UK gave Ukraine. Tomorrow the UK will push a draft UN security council resolution calling for the protection of civilians and unrestricted passage of aid in Sudan.</p> <p>During a visit to the UN security council in New York, foreign secretary David Lammy will urge the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) to keep the critical Adré border crossing with Chad open indefinitely and for the removal of restrictions that have curtailed the amount of aid passing through.</p> <p>“We cannot deliver aid without access. Starvation must not be used as a weapon of war and we can only stop this famine if every border crossing and route is open, accessible and safe,” said Lammy. UK officials hope the increased aid will support more than a million people affected by Sudan’s catastrophic conflict.</p> <p>Alarm is intensifying, however, over the ramifications of the ongoing fighting in el-Gezira state, Sudan’s agricultural heartland, which could dramatically limit food supplies.</p> <p>If no significant improvements materialise to boost the supply of food and humanitarian help, officials fear that Sudan’s death toll could end up running into the millions.</p> <p>On Friday a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/14/sudan-war-death-toll-much-higher-than-previously-recorded-new-study-finds">study</a> found that the death toll from Sudan’s civil war is already much higher than previously reported. Of more than 61,000 people who have died in Khartoum, researchers found that only 26,000 were killed through violence, with the leading cause of death across Sudan identified as preventable disease and starvation.</p> <p>Evidence also emerged last week that hundreds may have died in a cholera outbreak in the besieged town of al-Hilaliya in el-Gezira state. The RSF surrounded the town last month, home to tens of thousands of locals and displaced people.</p> <p>Despite the scale of the crisis facing Sudan, UN agencies <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157001">recently reiterated</a> the urgent need for additional funding. Currently the UN’s £2.14bn Sudan humanitarian appeal is only 57% funded, posing “significant challenges” to sustaining necessary relief efforts. More than 500,000 people in Darfur, west Sudan, are in famine conditions which is likely to spread. Throughout the country, 25 million are reliant on aid.</p>'

                            title: 'Trend watch: get ready for a country weekend'
                            content: '<p>Fashion’s longstanding love of heritage and dressing up in the style of those attending country-house weekends has dominated the runways this season, from Chloé’s cape silhouette plaid coat to Wales Bonner’s check barn jacket styled over a dark tweed two piece. Meanwhile labels such as Margaret Howell and Stefan Cooke have adopted hardwearing tweed, styled with denim or paired with a knit, and heavy-duty wool trousers in a palette of autumn hues, from mustard, olive green and russet to rich chestnut brown. It’s a look suitable for long walks in the countryside, with textured wool coats layered over quilted and canvas barn jackets, such as Mango’s contrasting collar version (6, below) or Sezane’s flap pocket design in camel, £285.</p> <p>Knitwear is the foundation to this look, an argyle cardigan or jumper that’s reminiscent of Brideshead Revisited, the Mitford sisters and off-duty royals at Balmoral. The argyle knit is a great entry-point to this trend, and &amp;Daughter’s Ava sweater (£395), made in Hawick, Scotland, is the real deal, made with responsible Wool Standard-certified wool. On the high street, M&amp;S (10) has a simplified graphic take on the design (£35). There are also plenty of pre-loved iterations to be found, for example at Beyond Retro and eBay. For day, keep things practical with flat boots: Whistles lugsole knee-high pair (£259) have an equestrian vibe that works for the trend. Alternatively, Blundstone’s ankle boots (£190) come in a variety of colours and weather-appropriate finishes. Mixing textures and pattern is key, try checks with wool and throw in some embellishment to stay on the right side of cosplay.</p> <p>It’s not just weekend walks attire either. Essentiel Antwerp’s checked mesh-covered midi skirt with silver palm-tree embroidery (£240) works for Christmas parties worn with a silk shirt and heels, while Gant’s pleated grey check skirt with red trim (£150) looks great with a cashmere sweater and crystal earrings. </p> <h2><strong>Mini kilt</strong></h2>    <p>£375, <a href="https://lekilt.co.uk/products/micro-mini-kilt-2">lekilt.co.uk</a></p> <h2><strong>Cardigan</strong></h2>    <p>£45.99, <a href="https://www.zara.com/uk/en/argyle-knit-cardigan-p00021124.html">zara.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Tote</strong></h2>    <p>£140,<a href="https://www.jwanderson.com/gb/shopping/canvas-tote-hedgehog-print-24264134?srsltid=AfmBOoqITFe_kez4LMvhi6AQVwnRVQ2lLUxCLXnql1EJqu-Kzu3DgFNJ"> jwanderson.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Socks</strong></h2>    <p>£14, <a href="https://www.burlington.de/uk_en/p/queen-women-socks/22004_8011/">burlington.de</a></p> <h2><strong>Loafers</strong></h2>    <p>£249, <a href="https://penelopechilvers.com/products/high-lorenzo-leather-loafer?">penelopechilver. co.uk</a></p> <h2><strong>Barn jacket</strong></h2>    <p>£99.99, <a href="https://shop.mango.com/gb/en/p/women/jackets/parka-with-contrasting-collar-and-pockets_77078264?c=37">mango.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Shirt</strong></h2>    <p>£140, <a href="https://www.withnothingunderneath.com/products/alexander-tencel-chocolate-stripe-x-felicity-kay">withnothingunderneath.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Knee high boots</strong></h2>    <p>£160.00, <a href="https://www.clarks.com/en-gb/orinoco-2-tall/26179097-p">clarks.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Skirt</strong></h2>    <p>£150, <a href="https://www.gant.co.uk/check-print-pleated-skirt-evening-blue/7325707733574.html?">gant.co.uk</a></p> <h2><strong>Jumper</strong></h2>    <p>£35, <a href="https://www.marksandspencer.com/argyle-crew-neck-jumper-with-wool/p/clp60688334">marksandspencer.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Chunky boot</strong></h2>    <p>£195, <a href="https://www.whistles.com/product/hatton-chunky-chelsea-boot-35481.html#suggestion=true">whistles.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Socks</strong></h2>    <p>£20 <a href="https://www.pantherella.com/harlow?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAoae5BhCNARIsADVLzZe3Sk39tAwn4EyJCMaTVMMK47RV2sRmJRy4okX24o2KmPqcRt_Sq1YaAgQoEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds#151=188">pantherella.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Argyle wool vest</strong></h2>    <p>£95, <a href="https://cos.com/en_gbp/women/womenswear/knitwear/product.argyle-wool-vest-grey.1247977001.html?">cos.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Midi skirt</strong></h2>    <p>£89.95, <a href="https://www.massimodutti.com/gb/flounce-midi-skirt-l05288288?srsltid=AfmBOopLgAEULoNdFhmHRe9I5oXnfEJ8UHCxd9SNmGyHVyClTcHGQdx2">massimodutti.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Blazer</strong></h2>    <p>£79.99, <a href="https://shop.mango.com/gb/en/p/women/blazers/houndstooth-checked-blazer_77068271">mango.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Boots</strong></h2>    <p>£110.00, Tretorn <a href="https://www.toa.st/collections/womens-footwear/products/tretorn-terrang-winter-boots-brown-olive">toa.st</a></p> <h2><strong>Embellished skirt</strong></h2>    <p><strong>£240, </strong><a href="https://www.essentiel-antwerp.com/uk/p/green-skirt-greyhound">essentiel-antwerp.com</a></p> <h2><strong>Earrings</strong></h2>    <p><strong>£65, </strong><a href="https://www.essentiel-antwerp.com/uk/p/silver-earrings-gardia">essentiel-antwerp.com</a></p>'

Starring Mark Rylance as Henry VIII’s lowborn fixer, Thomas Cromwell, director Peter Kosminsky’s Bafta-winning adaptation felt as sluggish and laboured as Mantel’s writing was vivid and exciting. The series did ignite about two-thirds in, as Anne Boleyn (played with raw magnificence by Claire Foy) succumbed to trumped-up charges of treason, culminating in the unbearable, wind-lashed scenes of her beheading.</p> <p>Almost a decade later we’re plunged back into those terrible final moments in the opening episode of <strong><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0024z1n/wolf-hall-the-mirror-and-the-light-1-wreckage">Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light</a></strong>, based on Mantel’s concluding novel and again directed by Kosminsky and written by Peter Straughan. Here, Anne’s execution is intercut with Henry preparing for marriage to Jane Seymour (Kate Phillips) – the all-time king of toxic masculinity shrugging on weighty regalia and getting his beard trimmed in his latest bid for a legitimate male heir.</p> <p>“Such freshness, such delicacy,” he purrs of his wedding night to a guilt-ridden but carefully impassive Cromwell, who is rewarded by being made Lord Privy Seal. Alone, Cromwell is frequently visited by the ghost of his former master and true significant other, Cardinal Wolsey (Jonathan Pryce), who will soon remind him of Henry’s lethal caprice: “When fortune turns against you, you will feel the lash.”</p> <p>I suppose spoilers don’t count here; history contains all of those. Bar a few stodgy lulls, from the two episodes (of six) I’ve seen, this second series crackles with tension, driving forward the busy plot points: succession, ambition, peril, absolutism, religious turmoil, omnipresent female powerlessness and fear.</p> <p>Cromwell now seems much more akin to the self-possessed but uncompromising attack dog of the books. It also helps enormously to be able to see what’s happening; at times, the first series looked as if it had been filmed inside a candlelit Tudor duvet cover. Cast changes, such as Timothy Spall replacing the late Bernard Hill as the Duke of Norfolk, work well, while Lilit Lesser is dynamite as Catherine of Aragon’s daughter, Lady Mary.</p>    <p>Then there’s Damian Lewis. The role of Henry is tricky: easy to collapse into cosplay caricature. It doesn’t matter (to me, anyway) that the actor doesn’t look as if he reeks of Henry’s regal gout; it matters that he’s impulsive, mercurial, spoiled, shallow and petrifying, whether being applauded at masked balls by lickspittles or silkily glaring at Cromwell as, finally, the blacksmith’s son blunders into a huge mistake. Lewis is outstanding throughout.</p> <p>I was concerned about the second series of the jet-black comedy <strong><a href="https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/bad-sisters/umc.cmc.14kr4vv65unannh7doqgvlh20">Bad Sisters</a></strong> (Apple TV+). Could it be as compelling without Claes Bang as swaggering smoothie baddie John Paul, who was – spoiler klaxon – offed, after many demented attempts by the bickering Garvey sisters, trying to protect their sibling (his wife) Grace (Anne-Marie Duff). While the original <em>Bad Sisters</em> – adapted by Sharon Horgan, Dave Finkel and Brett Bauer from the Flemish series <em>Clan</em> – was meant as a standalone story, in season two, Horgan creates a new mystery and also writes some episodes.</p> <p>Early blissful scenes of Grace emerging, butterfly-like, from long-term abuse to marry new love Ian (Owen McDonnell) soon give way to the discovery of a corpse, chaos, desperation, police questioning, terrible tragedy and more for her sisters – played by Horgan (bossy Eva, who has a “menopause coach”), Eve Hewson (chaotic Becka, who performs a “nervous wee”), Eva Birthistle (perma-stressed medic Ursula) and Sarah Greene (foxy, eyepatch-sporting Bibi).</p>    <p>The plot becomes a little mangled, and while there are funny lines (“I love incense: it’s how I imagine Jesus smelled”), there are fewer than in the first series. That said, the ensemble playing remains pitch-perfect, and sweetly desperate neighbour Roger (Michael Smiley) is given a malevolent nosy churchwoman sister, Angelica, played with witchy naughtiness by Fiona Shaw. Yes, the suave horror of John Paul is missed, but over the course of eight episodes there’s still much to savour.</p> <p>New two-part BBC Two docuseries <strong><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0024qb1/immigration-how-british-politics-failed-series-1-episode-1">Immigration: How British Politics Failed</a></strong> is to be commended for tackling such a difficult subject, but it also proves the impossibility of having a coherent, intelligent national debate on the matter.</p> <p>Winding back to the early 00s, it’s interesting. Tony Blair talks about the migrant argument for economic growth. There’s an in-depth breakdown of major decisions and mistakes. There’s also a broad range of interviewees, including Andrew Green, whose Migration Watch thinktank produced data and analysis that David Cameron says proved “helpful” to the Conservatives.</p> <p>Unfortunately, every so often Nigel Farage bursts in, doing his Brexit panto routine. Early on he blares: “At least Tony Blair was honest. He said: We’re going to open the doors to the whole world.” (Yawn! Blair didn’t say that.) In next week’s episode, Farage says with ill-disguised relish: “Just you watch, this issue is going to get bigger and bigger.”</p> <p>Is his rather predictable input needed in all such documentaries? Couldn’t there just be a blank screen saying: “Please insert your own Nigel Farage bit here”? I’m not suggesting banning him (perish the thought!) – just giving him a wee rest on the topic of immigration. We can all agree he’s earned it.</p> <p>On Sky Atlantic, Lauren LeFranc’s <strong><a href="https://www.sky.com/watch/the-penguin">The Penguin</a></strong>, an eight-part TV-spin-off from 2022 film <em>The Batman</em>, concluded with the visceral virtuosity that, despite occasional slides into cheesy franchisedom, has made this the year’s most unexpected triumph. I won’t disclose the jaw-dropping and devastating late twist. I can reveal (lesser spoiler alert) that in the closing seconds, a bat logo appears in the sky above Gotham.</p>    <p>One of <em>The Penguin</em>’s secrets has been its committed story arc: it didn’t act like it had umpteen series to make a point. Nor was Oswald “Penguin” Cobb (Colin Farrell)<strong> </strong>played as a joke, but as an intimidating mobster, a charismatic leader, who wears his ugliness on the inside yet still has some to spare on the outside. Farrell’s achievement is that you forget he’s larded in a veritable acreage of prosthetics. You just remember his performance, and it’s staggering.</p> <p><em>Star ratings (out of five)<br>Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light</em> <strong>★★★★</strong><br><em>Bad Sisters</em> <strong>★★★★</strong><br><em>Immigration: How British Politics Failed</em> <strong>★★★</strong><br><em>The Penguin</em> <strong>★★★★</strong></p> <h2>What else I’m watching</h2> <p><strong><a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81685880">Sprint</a><br></strong>(Netflix)<br>The return of the fascinating fly-on-the-wall documentary about international sprinters – among them the irrepressible US champion Noah Lyles.

                            title: 'Learning to scoot is all very well, but what’s the point if you can’t ring your own bell? | Séamas O’Reilly'
                            content: '<p>Our two-year-old daughter mounts the scooter. She places one unsteady foot in front of the other on its central board. An initial attempt at balance is rebuffed as gravity asserts itself and she yelps as the scooter leaves her feet, throwing her backwards. Her helmet, pink and cream, remains in place. Miraculously, there are no tears. Undaunted, our little Boudicca rights her chariot and repeats.</p> <p>We’re in our local park, giving her – and us – a crash course in resilience. It is nail-biting. We bought her the thing in the hope we’d avoid the mess we made of her brother’s tutelage. He never warmed to the various scooters and bikes we’ve inherited from his older cousins and which now languish, substantially cobwebbed, in our shed. He showed no interest in using them, and we didn’t insist, due to the fact we weren’t particularly keen on equipping him with a vehicle that could wallop him into the path of cars at 20mph and, if we’re honest, pure old-fashioned laziness.</p> <p>Now, of course, we feel stupid when we visit friends and see the joy, and speedy transport, their kids’ scooters provide. My son shows no such regrets and runs alongside these friends as they scoot, like a secret service agent escorting a presidential motorcade, evincing zero discomfort or embarrassment over this commitment to radical pedestrianism. Part of me thinks he’s just doubling down on; that he can’t possibly enjoy stretching and sweating while his friends sail effortlessly beside him. But, if that is the case and it is all an act, I can’t help but admire him more. He may not have the resilience of his sister when it comes to scooting, but his stubbornness is a marvel.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>There’s no fear or trepidation on her face at all, just the hedonic rush of motion</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From his place on terra firma, he’s whispering encouragement in her ear. She’s back onboard and planning a tentative glide. He runs beside her as she finds her speed, a bright smile spreading across her face, and his. There’s no fear or trepidation on her face at all, just the hedonic rush of motion and the joy of seeing her fears crushed like so many mulched leaves under bright pink plastic wheels.</p> <p>On the way back, she is scooting as if she’s been doing it for years, and with a cocksure swagger that suggests she occasionally gives demonstrations for cash. As we round the corner for home, we pass an older girl scooting towards us. She’s about four and clearly a local scooter pilot of great acclaim. As we pass, she gives our daughter a special acknowledgment, tapping her helmet and waving to signify that they are sisters of the board. Our girl can’t disguise her delight, and knowing not what else to say simply shouts: ‘<em>Scooter</em>!’ The other girl laughs and, as if to baptise our daughter officially into the sect, lets out a sparkling ding-ding-ding from the bell on her handlebars. We consider this, in small girl terms, roughly equivalent to a knighthood, and we turn to see how our little apprentice is taking it.<br>She’s staring, dumbfounded at the gap between her hand and the handlebars where we never thought to place a bell, motioning futile presses with her thumb.<br>‘Where’s my ding-ding-ding?’ she says, very close to tears.</p> <p><em>Follow Séamas on X </em><em><a href="https://twitter.com/shockproofbeats?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@shockproofbeats</a></em></p>'

                            title: 'Colm Tóibín: ‘Ireland today is a much freer place’'
                            content: '<p>Born in 1955, Colm Tóibín has written short stories, poetry, plays, essays and even opera libretti. He remains best known as a novelist, garnering laurels including the International Dublin literary award and the David Cohen prize for literature, and being praised for his sheer range as well as a near-magical ability to capture all that goes unsaid in life. His greatest commercial success to date is <em>Brooklyn </em>(2009), which follows Eilis Lacey as she leaves her home town – and Tóibín’s own – of Enniscorthy, County Wexford, for greater opportunities in the US. It later became a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/08/brooklyn-observer-film-review-saoirse-ronan">film starring Saoirse Ronan</a>. His 11th novel, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/may/19/long-island-by-colm-toibin-review-sequel-to-breakthrough-brooklyn#:~:text=Long%20Island%20often%20reads%20like,but%20is%20a%20vivid%20highlight.">Long Island</a></em>, is the sequel he swore he’d never write, catching up with Eilis two decades on. Tóibín divides his time between Los Angeles and New York City, where he teaches English literature at Columbia University.</p> <p><em><strong>Long Island</strong></em><strong> is on the shortlist for Waterstones </strong><strong>book of the </strong><strong>year, which must be nice…<br></strong>It cheers you up. You work tentatively as a writer – you think this might work and that might work but you’re trying things. This is one of the ways where you feel that maybe you got something right.</p> <p><strong>You’re not a fan of sequels. Have you changed your opinion in light of </strong><em><strong>Long Island</strong></em><strong>’s reception?<br></strong>I haven’t. The idea that a novel would have a sequel, that the ending is merely provisional, I think really makes a difference to the experience of reading the book. A novel is not a line, it doesn’t just chug along like a train. It is an actual arc, and you have to have a real sense of that as a reader. </p> <p><strong>So why did you make an exception?<br></strong><em>Long Island</em> is set 20 years later and has an entirely different structure to <em>Brooklyn</em>. It moves only according to the rules of plot, so it is a different book in that sense.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>I do get homesick, yes. It’s the music that gets me. My partner will say: ''Oh my God, he’s putting on the music…''</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Did returning to characters you first conjured into being in 2009 make you aware of changes in yourself as a writer? <br></strong>I saw the film [<em>Brooklyn</em>] a good lot. Normally, in film and novels, Irishmen are unreliable, charming, brooding. It makes making an Irishman who’s quiet and stable particularly difficult. Jim in <em>Brooklyn</em> is a very nice fellow but he’s not the point of the book. The actor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/jul/31/on-my-radar-domhnall-gleeson-cultural-highlights">Domhnall Gleeson</a> managed to give him a sort of glow, a strange power that came from his quietness. I saw a new way his character could be done, so Jim in <em>Long Island</em> derived partly from my watching of the film. I can’t find a precedent for it, where a novelist gets a gift like that.</p> <p><strong>Do you continue to think of Ireland as home, and if so, do you get homesick? <br></strong>Yes. It’s the music that gets me. My partner will say: “Oh my God, he’s putting on the music…” I could on a given night, for no reason, find myself listening to some song, like Kevin Burke and Micheál Ó Domhnaill’s Lord Franklin, and then I’ll put on another… It’s like being a drunken Irishman, except I don’t drink any more.</p>    <p><strong>How often do you go back to Enniscorthy? <br></strong>I’ve just been there now because the opera I wrote the libretto for, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/26/the-week-in-classical-wexford-festival-opera-le-convenienze-ed-inconvenienze-teatrali-donizetti-the-critic-stanford-le-maschere-mascagni-lady-gregory-in-america-colm-toibin-alberto-caruso-review">Lady Gregory in America</a></em>, was on at Wexford Festival Opera. I like to think of it as the people’s opera – it was on at 11 in the morning and it only cost €25 [£21] to go to. A lot of local people booked and there was a nice feeling. I’ll be back for Christmas.</p> <p><strong>Ireland today is very different </strong><strong>from the country you grew up in and left in the 1970s. For starters, it’s a lot easier to be gay… <br></strong>It’s a much freer place. The gay thing was odd and unexpected because it was a conservative movement. It was families saying we want our families to be strengthened by the presence of our gay son, and the gay son saying I want my own family. It was the two words that the church had taken from us that we took back: family and love.</p> <p><strong>As a teenager, you thought seriously about becoming a priest. Do you have any residual faith? <br></strong>Oh, residual – I’m <em>all</em> residual! But no, I’m an atheist.</p> <p><strong>You underwent treatment for aggressive cancer in 2018. Were you tempted to try to revive your religious beliefs? <br></strong>It never arose. It was a very secular time – dosage, different medicines, sleep. There wasn’t a spiritual moment.</p> <p><strong>LA seems an unlikely place for you to have landed. There’s a perception that it’s unintellectual</strong><strong> – somehow “lite”… <br></strong>None of that’s true. The only thing you can’t do here is flaneur around. You really live in your back yard and your life depends on the quality of your back yard, where the sun falls and where the shadows fall, and where the pomegranate tree is and where the passion fruit vine is. It’s a funny thing if you’re Irish to talk about – not where the potatoes and the cabbages are.</p> <p><strong>We should probably talk about Donald Trump. Were you shocked by the US election result?<br></strong>I was. It’s a disaster – it sets everything back. There’s no area in which Trump’s presence in America is in any way helpful, and there’s something grotesque about the people around him. I’ve utter contempt for Mitch McConnell [the outgoing Senate minority leader and staunch Trump ally].</p> <p><strong>Do you think his presidency will have a draining effect on the nation’s creative industries, as energies are focused on activism? <br></strong>The thing to do is to close the door and get on with making books. It’s what WB Yeats said about the funeral of Parnell in Ireland in 1891 – now, after politics has utterly failed us, the imagination can come to the fore. It would have been better were it the other way around.</p> <p><strong>What are your thoughts on turning 70 next year?<br></strong>It’s <em>very</em> old. There’s nothing else to be said.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Long Island </em>is published by Picador (£20)<em>. </em>To support the <em>Guardian</em> and <em>Observer</em> order your copy at<a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/long-island-9781035029440/"> guardianbookshop.com</a>.

                      title: '‘It has been a year since I felt joy’: Paul Sagar on coming to terms with the climbing accident that paralysed him'
                      content: '<p>Paul Sagar, 37, is reader in political theory in the department of political economy at King’s College London. He studied at the universities of Cambridge, Oxford and London and in 2020 received the British and Irish Association for Political Thought early career award for excellence in research and teaching. A once passionate rock climber, he suffered a catastrophic accident last year while climbing in Scotland. The accident left him tetraplegic, paralysed from the collarbones down, with only residual use of his hands. After eight months in hospital, he resumed academic work in early 2024, continuing physical rehabilitation and attempting to adjust to life with severe disability. This is an extract from his diary of the past 16 months.</p> <h2><strong>22 August 2023</strong></h2> <p>On 5 June, I was climbing in Glencoe with a friend. Because of friability in the rock, a route we had thought to be in unusually safe condition turned out to be almost lethal. On the final pitch, as I was leading, the rock collapsed and much of my gear exploded out of the placements. I fell about 20 metres. My left arm was shattered severely, and my right arm was also broken, albeit less badly. Worst of all I fractured two vertebrae in my neck.</p> <p>Luckily, I was climbing with a surgeon that day and through amazing good fortune and his incredible skill and composure, he saved my life. I was airlifted to Glasgow hospital where I had several operations and awoke four weeks later. After a period of drug-induced insanity I eventually came to something like my senses. Since then, I have been transferred to the Royal London hospital, where I am undergoing the start of a very long physio journey.</p> <p>At present, I have limited use of my hands and no control of my body below my abdominal muscles. This is not exactly how I planned to spend my summer, to say the least.</p> <p>I have written this short post using voice dictation software, partly just to prove to myself that I can. The likelihood is I will never walk again, let alone climb.</p> <h2><strong>1 September</strong></h2> <p>If I had to pick the single worst thing about living in hospital, there would be some stiff competition. There is the constant disruption, having no control over when I wake up, with people barging into the room at whatever time suits them to jab me with needles or slam bin lids. There is the total dependency on others to complete the most mundane of tasks, be it feeding myself or getting my teeth brushed. There is the infuriating frequency with which staff will talk about me when I’m in the room, or ask each other questions that I know the answers to, but which they do not bother to consult me about because the default assumption is that the patient is clueless.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>I want to be an able-bodied man with his life back. The fact this is impossible doesn’t stop me wanting it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, the number one worst thing about being an early stage spinal injury patient in hospital is, for me at least, the daily humiliation. You see, an aspect of spinal injury I wasn’t aware of until it happened to me is that it’s not just that you lose the ability to use your legs and possibly your hands . You also lose functional control of your bowels and bladder. </p> <p>Hence this week I underwent a minor surgery to drill a tube directly into my bladder, making my penis effectively redundant. I have anyway by now lost count of the number of strangers who have either seen or had to wash my genitals.</p>    <h2><strong>11 September</strong></h2> <p>Who am I? It’s hard to be sure any more. In recent days I have found it harder and harder to shake the feeling that I am an impostor. Increasingly I am struck with the sense that somebody did die that day in early June. I share his name, his legal details, his date of birth, and even his memories. Other people seem to think that I am him. But I am increasingly unsure. I look at the arms attached to me now, and they are thin like twigs. Forearms have disappeared completely, while biceps are a rump of what once was. When I have glanced at my chest during occasions of being washed, I am astounded to see that it simply no longer exists. There is just flat bone above visible ribs. When attempting to do the most basic of exercises, a mind that remembers developing serious core strength over years tries to engage abdominal muscles that cannot perform even the beginning of a single measly sit-up. And then, of course, there are the hands that barely function and the legs that do not move at all. The person who woke up on 5 June looked and felt absolutely nothing like this.</p> <p>Somebody died that day, and somebody different survived. I am the survivor, playing the role once held by a dead man, and every day slightly puzzled as to why nobody seems to have noticed the switch.</p> <h2><strong>1 October</strong></h2> <p><em>I am now in the </em><em>rehab department</em><em> at the </em><em>Royal National Orthopaedic hospital</em><em> at </em><em>Stanmore, Middlesex</em><em>.</em></p> <p>Conversation matters. It distracts me from my situation and connects me to a world beyond my circular thoughts. But it’s also risky. Topics that ought to be safe are, for me, not necessarily so.</p> <p>Take the weather. Comments on the unseasonable warmth we’re having are tough for me to hear. Yes, it means I can visit the rehab centre gardens. On the other hand, I immediately think of how I’m not out climbing in such perfect weekend conditions. And never will be again.</p> <p>Many remarks can trigger pain without the other person meaning to, or even realising. Take the friendly Irish nurse who tonight told me of her love of hiking in the Peak District, her trips to the Lake District, her walks in Switzerland. It took all my strength not to reply <em>you have no fucking idea</em>. <em>I didn’t just hike those places. I saw and accessed sights you can’t even imagine</em>. And then my mind is flooded with all the places I’ll never see again. The North London Mountaineering Club hut in Snowdonia, my home from home that I planned to visit regularly until I died. Wen Zawn at Gogarth. My favourite Kalymnos bar. Portland sport routes. The Borrowdale trad crags. The view of Italy from 3,000m. The feeling of slinging a full rucksack back into the van after a long day’s effort. Wyoming. El Chorro. Fontainebleau. Never again. And the list goes on.</p> <p>It might sound strange but the emotion I feel in relation to this is heartbreak. I realised this today after a kind nursing assistant asked me (respectfully, in appropriate circumstances) what my accident had been. I told her the story. And then I began to cry. A 36-year-old man in tears, in front of a near stranger.</p> <h2><strong>5 October</strong></h2> <p>The truth is I’m finding rehab very hard. After spending nearly three months fixating on getting here, the reality of starting intensive physio and therapy is not the instant salvation I had hoped it would be.</p> <p>The rehab team gave me a power wheelchair this week, which restores a modicum of independence. All I can think about, however, is how small the rehab centre is, having now lapped it dozens of times. And about how winter will soon make even the gardens inaccessible. And this is where I will spend every day for months. The other night we were lucky enough to listen to music performed live in the large outdoor pod. Upbeat songs about love and joy? They just make me think about how I don’t have a partner, I don’t have children, and I’ve realistically blown any chance at either from here on out. So what is left to give the fight meaning? What’s the point?</p>    <h2><strong>19 October</strong></h2> <p>I am no longer the only published author among the patients at rehab. Indeed, I’m not even close to being the most widely read any more. That’s because a couple of weeks ago <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/12/my-body-is-broken-but-im-not-going-to-give-up-hanif-kureishi-on-life-after-the-accident-that-paralysed-him">Hanif Kureishi</a> arrived to also undergo rehabilitation. As well as being a successful novelist and screenwriter, Hanif directly inspired me to start these blogs. That’s because he has been dictating Substack posts via his partner and children since he suffered a debilitating spinal cord injury himself on Boxing Day last year. I was made aware of his regular “dispatches” while in Royal London hospital, and read all of them. It was helpful to hear what somebody else going through the same kind of experience as me was making of it, and it brought me solace when he wrote about struggling with some of the same things that I have. More generally it made me think that if he could write, then I should try writing too. And so I did.</p> <p>Hanif and I have had a couple of good conversations since he arrived, but nothing is ever easy in this new life and he is now mostly isolated for infection control reasons.</p> <h2><strong>3 December</strong></h2> <p>I’ve written before about how utterly overwhelming this experience is. Well it turns out that it doesn’t get easier with time. I didn’t realise one could be overwhelmed by constantly feeling overwhelmed. Overwhelm fatigue. Metawhelmed, if you like. That’s where I’m at right now. My mind is a cacophony of paradoxical, or at least incoherent, thoughts.</p> <p>Here’s an example. Last week was my “case conference”, when the therapists and medical leads here sat down with my parents and I to discuss my progress to date, and future steps. They congratulated me on having made real gains as a result of trying very hard in my various physio and therapy sessions, and therefore extending my admission by another month. This is only done for people who have made progress and whom it is believed will make further gains if they stay longer. By no means does everyone get extended.</p> <p>Great news for me, right? Of course I can see that this is ultimately positive. My parents were a little baffled, however, as to why I nonetheless apparently took so little cheer from it. The answer is that I find it hard to be uplifted by progress towards a goal that I fundamentally don’t want. The brute truth is that I don’t want to be a better-than-expected tetraplegic. I want to be an able-bodied man with his life back. And the fact this is impossible doesn’t stop me wanting it. </p> <h2><strong>26 January 2024</strong></h2> <p>If nothing else, the past half a year has made me acutely aware of how dependent on family one becomes even while living in the heart of the NHS. If it weren’t for my mother and father, I would be truly screwed. It would have been impossible for me to single-handedly deal with things like securing accommodation for the future, let alone communicating with my employer and various crucial organisations during the first few months of my injury. As far as I can tell, after an accident like mine, those who don’t have family to pick up the pieces are in the direst of dire&nbsp;straits.</p> <p>So I’m lucky to have parents who care enough, and are competent enough and financially stable enough, to offer me serious help in rebuilding something like a life. And for this, of course, I am grateful. Which leads to a question: why then do I sometimes behave like such a shit?</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>The most painful thing is sorting old clothes. Every item had a connection to my former life and put a dagger through my heart</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Last weekend was not my finest hour. Having made the long trek down from Merseyside to the rehab centre just outside Watford, my mum and dad came to spend time with me. And I rewarded them with toddler levels of truculence and incivility. Why can’t I behave nicely, as a fitting display of the gratitude that I do genuinely feel towards them?</p> <p>The answer I think lies, at least in part, in the fact that half a year ago I was an independent adult with his own income, career, projects, and so forth, but I am now effectively reduced to the status of a child. I need Mummy and Daddy to help me with everything in life. And this is a very difficult thing to come to terms with. And if one is now living like a baby, why not act like one?</p> <p>Add to that the fact that I’m now in the position of having to be grateful <em>all the time</em>: to the person that wipes my arse, to whoever washes me, or puts my clothes on or brushes my teeth. I am grateful to the person that brings my lunch out and puts it in front of me, to the nurse who puts my afternoon medication into my mouth. I am grateful to the staff in the gym that I spend most of the day with, most of whom by now have had to cope with either my piss or shit at least once. I am grateful to whichever persons put me to bed before propping up my iPad so that I can watch some crap on Netflix before falling asleep and repeating it all again.</p> <p>The result of this is what one might call gratitude exhaustion. </p> <h2><strong>5 February</strong></h2> <p>One of the many things that I never appreciated about my old life is that I was virtually never bored. My work consisted mostly of reading and discussing interesting ideas with colleagues and students. If I got bored during the day, I’d amuse myself by playing online chess (poorly). I trained for climbing 10 to 15 hours a week, while weekends were almost always spent driving somewhere it wasn’t raining so as to climb outdoors.</p> <p>Evenings after training left time for good-quality TV, or reading a novel. And of course there were always friends to catch up with in London if I ever felt like actually being sociable. Failing that, I’d go fishing. Essentially, if I was awake I was active, either in body or mind. A lazy weekend, doing nothing, was something like my idea of a bad time.</p> <p>The contrast with my new life could hardly be more stark. I now regularly spend chunks of time just doing nothing. </p> <p>The strangest thing, though, is how accustomed I have become to this mode of living. Seconds become minutes, become hours, become days. Time just drifts by unfilled, and I watch as it passes. I’m bored, but weirdly indifferent about that boredom. It doesn’t drive me crazy like it would have before. I’ve become somebody else; somebody I don’t especially admire, but who seems worryingly like they are here to stay.</p> <h2><strong>10 March</strong></h2> <p>I have now moved on to a nursing home. There is no doubt that it is an improvement on living behind a curtain in a hospital ward. Nonetheless, I have the sense of starring in my own personal <em>Groundhog</em> <em>Day</em>. Every day is basically the same. Mornings are lost, waiting for my various needs to be dealt with. Afternoons I spend trying to work, with decreasing levels of enthusiasm. Evenings I play some online chess, wondering how it is possible to get progressively worse as the days pass. Then it is back to bed for yet more TV. Rinse, repeat. I never go anywhere new. I have no plans. There are no holidays to look forward to. No weekends away. Just more of the same, day after day. Bill Murray, I get it now.</p> <p>And so it might not be especially surprising to hear that I am not doing very well psychologically. Leaving the hell of rehab, getting some minimal privacy, and being able to read serious work for the first time in months gave me an initial mental boost. But it is not especially surprising that this was not a magic cure. And yet I am still taken aback by the scale of my mental collapse. I feel as hopeless, as unable to accept and adapt, as at any other time since I regained consciousness. For a few weeks, I genuinely thought I was getting better. I do not feel even remotely close to that any more.</p>    <p>All of which has led me to a decision. I have begun the process of formally applying to Dignitas, with the eventual possibility of assisted suicide. Many more steps will be required if I am ultimately to go through with this, and I will have the option of changing my mind at many points in the future. (Some people have tried to tell me that I will not be eligible because I am not terminally ill, but I have done my research and although there is no guarantee that I will be accepted for consideration, tetraplegics from Britain have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/27/the-britons-who-made-their-final-journey-to-dignitas-clinic">used the Swiss service before</a>.) At the very least, what this gives me is the psychological comfort of knowing there is an escape route. I am so tired of feeling completely trapped, forced to stay alive by other people, with all the power and control removed from my own life. Even if I don’t take the option, knowing that the option is at least there provides a kind of comfort: the knowledge that I still have a final small amount of meaningful agency, that I can finally make this <em>stop</em> if I want to.</p> <h2><strong>11 May</strong></h2> <p>Last week I completed the long process of losing my home. The apartment I lived in for three years has changed hands, and now belongs to somebody else. And it hurts so much.</p> <p>The place was very modest; just a small one-bedroom flat. But it was <em>mine</em>. Those were my bookshelves. My choices of mountainscape on the wall. My arrangement of furniture. My base of operations for work, whenever I wasn’t travelling, trying to get as much time in the great outdoors as I could. Shortly before my accident, as a way of channelling the emotional pain from the breakup of a four-year relationship I had repainted most of the walls and doors, even had a new carpet fitted in the bedroom. And then one day I walked out and drove away, not knowing that it was for the last time. Nobody told me that I would never see the place again. I never got to say goodbye.</p> <h2><strong>5 June</strong></h2> <p>It has been a year to the day since my accident. A year since I woke up somewhere peaceful, somewhere quiet, at a time of my own choosing. Since it was up to me alone how long I stayed in bed. A year since I could piss standing up, of my own volition, rather than it dribbling out of me into a plastic bag. A year since I made my own breakfast. Since I was able to lift a normal cup of coffee. A year since I was able to drive, often hundreds of miles at a time, just to be outdoors and in the wild.</p> <p>Far more than a year since I held a woman’s hand, felt the touch of a human body against mine. But a year since these things were even possible for me; something that could sanely be hoped for some future day. A year since it was physically possible for me to enjoy exercise, or use it as a weapon against the parasite of depression that now resides in regal ascendancy over my mind. A year since I climbed. That indescribable world of adventure, which gave my life satisfaction and meaning. The antidote to the psychological ill-health that an academic career made me otherwise so especially vulnerable to.</p> <p>A year since I woke up even just indifferent about, let alone looking forward to, the day ahead. A year since my first thought hasn’t been wishing that I had died in the night. A year since I felt more than fleeting moments of happiness. A year since I felt joy.</p> <p>A year since I died.</p> <p>A year since I was reborn into a life I never agreed to, and would never have chosen, but am condemned by others to continue. A lot can change in a year. And so perhaps, out of the darkness, comes also the light of hope.</p> <h2><strong>18 June</strong></h2> <p>Through the herculean efforts of my parents, I now have a new place to call my own. And making the adjustment has been perhaps the most difficult thing I have been through so far.</p> <p>I really didn’t think it would be this way. While nervous, before the date of the move I experienced a definite uptick in mood. This began to fade once we pulled on to the North Circular. Here was a route I had driven many times in my old life. The store where I bought furniture for my first apartment. The pet shop where I sometimes got supplies for the cats (that I no longer have). The turning I used to take to the Lea Valley to fish for pike in the winter. When I last saw these places, I was driving my own van. Now I was in the back of an ambulance, being awkwardly jolted around. Memories came flooding back punching me in the gut, reminding me how much I have lost.</p> <p>My mum came down to meet the ambulance crew and help transfer me and my possessions up into the new flat.</p> <p>One thing stopping this apartment from feeling like a home is that the walls are all bare. The answer to which would normally be obvious and easy: hang up my own pictures. But there’s the rub. Hanging any of my old artwork on the walls is almost too painful to contemplate, not least because a lot of it consists of framed pictures of mountains. Mountains <em>that</em> <em>I</em> <em>have</em> <em>climbed</em>. Even non-climbing artwork inevitably comes with memories of previous homes it has hung in; past times in my past life; friends in happier years.</p> <p>But pictures were by no means the worst of it. Also transported from my old home to my new were my old clothes. The problem is that now I can’t wear most of them. All of my old jeans, and anything with a button or a buckle, now poses the threat of pressure sores. When it comes to upper layers, anything snug against my former physique is now impossible to combine with the repulsive potbelly I permanently sport. So I agreed to help my mum triage my old clothes, deciding what to keep and what to throw away.</p> <p>I don’t think I’m exaggerating when I say this is the most painful thing I’ve ever had to do. Virtually every piece of clothing had some connection to my former life: climbing gear, bouldering gym merch, T-shirts from climbing destinations, outdoor brands – aside from the odd Guns N’ Roses T-shirt, almost every item put a dagger through my heart. Or rather, two daggers. One for myself, who died. One for climbing, the love I lost.</p> <h2><strong>7 August</strong></h2> <p>It’s been a while, and enough people have been in contact in various ways, asking if I’m all right, that I feel a quick update is in order. In the grand scheme of things, yes. On the physical side, putting aside for now that my body is a wreckage site that will only get worse with time, I’m doing OK. No further complications, with UTIs and spasms under control, for once.</p> <p>On the mental side, well… it’s a process. My occupational therapist in rehab told me that most people find the first three to six months after leaving hospital the hardest. My physical therapist said I should expect the first year to be “hell”. So far, I can’t argue with that. I’ve been able to distract myself with academic research and writing, which is certainly more than nothing. But it’s hard to feel like it’s enough.</p>    <h2><strong>25 October</strong></h2> <p>I have been watching the debate over changing the UK’s law on assisted dying with sardonic interest. On the face of it the debate should have nothing to do with me. I, after all, am not terminally ill, and what is being debated is whether people with six months or less to live should be able to die by suicide with medical help. I simply don’t meet the criteria. However, those who oppose a change in the law often claim that if the law is loosened, we will be on a slippery slope down to a place where <em>people</em> <em>like</em> <em>me </em>(disabled people) are not only offered assisted suicide, but pressed by wider society into taking that option. And as this would be bad, the law should stay as it is. On the other side, those who favour changing the law vigorously deny (at least in public) that any such slippery slope will be encountered – and thus they implicitly or explicitly agree that assisted suicide should only be for those who, to put it bluntly, are going to die soon anyway. Hence, again, it is <em>not</em> <em>for me. </em>The effect of which is to compound my overwhelming sense that I am trapped in a living nightmare from which I cannot escape.</p> <p>When medical professionals decided that my ruined body should live, whether I might have wanted it to or not, they also determined that any future choice about whether to continue would for ever be taken away from me. Whereas a normal-bodied (or even just less disabled) person could take matters into their own hands and decide that enough is enough, I cannot. I need the help of someone else. And the law is pretty clear that nobody is allowed to help me. Hence, trapped. The potential loophole here is of course to go abroad, to a jurisdiction where medically assisted suicide is legal. And so, I’m working on it. The application to Dignitas is active.</p> <h2><strong>11 November</strong></h2> <p>In ancient Greek mythology, Pandora is said to have unleashed a range of curses upon humankind. Curiosity led her to open a box entrusted to her husband, out of which death, sickness and a host of other evils escaped. But left behind, so the story goes, was hope.</p> <p>One way to read this is as a sort of consolation. That despite all the evils humanity is forced to endure, we are able to cling to the light of hope. But I’ve long suspected (both before my accident, and especially since) that hope is the worst curse of them all.</p> <p>Moral philosophers like Adam Smith would rightly point out that being in a wheelchair, with virtually useless hands, is not a permanent obstacle to mental tranquillity. Plenty of happy tetraplegics prove it to be so (and indeed, I have met some of them). If I first <em>accept</em> my situation, and allow my psychology to adjust to it, it should be possible to escape the pit of despair.</p> <p>But I am consumed by a hope that holds me back. This comes in the form of longing for medical and technological advances that somehow “cure” spinal cord injury. This is indulged by regular Google searches along those lines. Like the other night, when I went down the rabbit hole of investigating NVG-291, the leading candidate for a therapeutic treatment, now in <a href="https://nervgen.com/cto/">phase 1b/2a human trials</a>. Riding the high of hope, I convince myself that I’m only going to have to do this for a few years, and then I’m going to get my life back. But then the hope wears off, and reality hits: that even if it lives up to the most optimistic hopes, NVG-291 is only going to restore partial functions, and will anyway take years to arrive in a clinically administered setting. And even if it does arrive, I am not getting my old life back, because that life is now definitively over.</p> <p>As the saying goes, it’s the hope that kills you. My hope is a curse. I need it to die. I need to accept.</p> <p>Maybe tomorrow.</p> <ul> <li><p>Read Paul Sagar’s Substack, Diary of a Punter, <a href="https://diaryofapunter.substack.com/">here</a></p></li> </ul>'

He attended both the Republican and the Democrat national conventions and engaged with people across the board. I know that he was in regular contact with the head of the Republican campaign committee as well, as well as the Democrats.”</p> <p>In a separate interview with Sky News, also from Peru, Albanese said his 10-minute congratulatory phone conversation with Trump had been “very constructive and positive” and Rudd was not mentioned.</p> <p>“He’s Australia’s ambassador to Washington, and he’s doing a very important job,” Albanese said. “The work that he did with Aukus was a difficult task to get that through the Congress and the Senate.

                        title: '‘It has been a year since I felt joy’: Paul Sagar on coming to terms with the climbing accident that paralysed him'
                        content: '<p>Paul Sagar, 37, is reader in political theory in the department of political economy at King’s College London. He studied at the universities of Cambridge, Oxford and London and in 2020 received the British and Irish Association for Political Thought early career award for excellence in research and teaching. A once passionate rock climber, he suffered a catastrophic accident last year while climbing in Scotland. The accident left him tetraplegic, paralysed from the collarbones down, with only residual use of his hands. After eight months in hospital, he resumed academic work in early 2024, continuing physical rehabilitation and attempting to adjust to life with severe disability. This is an extract from his diary of the past 16 months.</p> <h2><strong>22 August 2023</strong></h2> <p>On 5 June, I was climbing in Glencoe with a friend. Because of friability in the rock, a route we had thought to be in unusually safe condition turned out to be almost lethal. On the final pitch, as I was leading, the rock collapsed and much of my gear exploded out of the placements. I fell about 20 metres. My left arm was shattered severely, and my right arm was also broken, albeit less badly. Worst of all I fractured two vertebrae in my neck.</p> <p>Luckily, I was climbing with a surgeon that day and through amazing good fortune and his incredible skill and composure, he saved my life. I was airlifted to Glasgow hospital where I had several operations and awoke four weeks later. After a period of drug-induced insanity I eventually came to something like my senses. Since then, I have been transferred to the Royal London hospital, where I am undergoing the start of a very long physio journey.</p> <p>At present, I have limited use of my hands and no control of my body below my abdominal muscles. This is not exactly how I planned to spend my summer, to say the least.</p> <p>I have written this short post using voice dictation software, partly just to prove to myself that I can. The likelihood is I will never walk again, let alone climb.</p> <h2><strong>1 September</strong></h2> <p>If I had to pick the single worst thing about living in hospital, there would be some stiff competition. There is the constant disruption, having no control over when I wake up, with people barging into the room at whatever time suits them to jab me with needles or slam bin lids. There is the total dependency on others to complete the most mundane of tasks, be it feeding myself or getting my teeth brushed. There is the infuriating frequency with which staff will talk about me when I’m in the room, or ask each other questions that I know the answers to, but which they do not bother to consult me about because the default assumption is that the patient is clueless.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>I want to be an able-bodied man with his life back. The fact this is impossible doesn’t stop me wanting it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, the number one worst thing about being an early stage spinal injury patient in hospital is, for me at least, the daily humiliation. You see, an aspect of spinal injury I wasn’t aware of until it happened to me is that it’s not just that you lose the ability to use your legs and possibly your hands . You also lose functional control of your bowels and bladder. </p> <p>Hence this week I underwent a minor surgery to drill a tube directly into my bladder, making my penis effectively redundant. I have anyway by now lost count of the number of strangers who have either seen or had to wash my genitals.</p>    <h2><strong>11 September</strong></h2> <p>Who am I? It’s hard to be sure any more. In recent days I have found it harder and harder to shake the feeling that I am an impostor. Increasingly I am struck with the sense that somebody did die that day in early June. I share his name, his legal details, his date of birth, and even his memories. Other people seem to think that I am him. But I am increasingly unsure. I look at the arms attached to me now, and they are thin like twigs. Forearms have disappeared completely, while biceps are a rump of what once was. When I have glanced at my chest during occasions of being washed, I am astounded to see that it simply no longer exists. There is just flat bone above visible ribs. When attempting to do the most basic of exercises, a mind that remembers developing serious core strength over years tries to engage abdominal muscles that cannot perform even the beginning of a single measly sit-up. And then, of course, there are the hands that barely function and the legs that do not move at all. The person who woke up on 5 June looked and felt absolutely nothing like this.</p> <p>Somebody died that day, and somebody different survived. I am the survivor, playing the role once held by a dead man, and every day slightly puzzled as to why nobody seems to have noticed the switch.</p> <h2><strong>1 October</strong></h2> <p><em>I am now in the </em><em>rehab department</em><em> at the </em><em>Royal National Orthopaedic hospital</em><em> at </em><em>Stanmore, Middlesex</em><em>.</em></p> <p>Conversation matters. It distracts me from my situation and connects me to a world beyond my circular thoughts. But it’s also risky. Topics that ought to be safe are, for me, not necessarily so.</p> <p>Take the weather. Comments on the unseasonable warmth we’re having are tough for me to hear. Yes, it means I can visit the rehab centre gardens. On the other hand, I immediately think of how I’m not out climbing in such perfect weekend conditions. And never will be again.</p> <p>Many remarks can trigger pain without the other person meaning to, or even realising. Take the friendly Irish nurse who tonight told me of her love of hiking in the Peak District, her trips to the Lake District, her walks in Switzerland. It took all my strength not to reply <em>you have no fucking idea</em>. <em>I didn’t just hike those places. I saw and accessed sights you can’t even imagine</em>. And then my mind is flooded with all the places I’ll never see again. The North London Mountaineering Club hut in Snowdonia, my home from home that I planned to visit regularly until I died. Wen Zawn at Gogarth. My favourite Kalymnos bar. Portland sport routes. The Borrowdale trad crags. The view of Italy from 3,000m. The feeling of slinging a full rucksack back into the van after a long day’s effort. Wyoming. El Chorro. Fontainebleau. Never again. And the list goes on.</p> <p>It might sound strange but the emotion I feel in relation to this is heartbreak. I realised this today after a kind nursing assistant asked me (respectfully, in appropriate circumstances) what my accident had been. I told her the story. And then I began to cry. A 36-year-old man in tears, in front of a near stranger.</p> <h2><strong>5 October</strong></h2> <p>The truth is I’m finding rehab very hard. After spending nearly three months fixating on getting here, the reality of starting intensive physio and therapy is not the instant salvation I had hoped it would be.</p> <p>The rehab team gave me a power wheelchair this week, which restores a modicum of independence. All I can think about, however, is how small the rehab centre is, having now lapped it dozens of times. And about how winter will soon make even the gardens inaccessible. And this is where I will spend every day for months. The other night we were lucky enough to listen to music performed live in the large outdoor pod. Upbeat songs about love and joy? They just make me think about how I don’t have a partner, I don’t have children, and I’ve realistically blown any chance at either from here on out. So what is left to give the fight meaning? What’s the point?</p>    <h2><strong>19 October</strong></h2> <p>I am no longer the only published author among the patients at rehab. Indeed, I’m not even close to being the most widely read any more. That’s because a couple of weeks ago <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/oct/12/my-body-is-broken-but-im-not-going-to-give-up-hanif-kureishi-on-life-after-the-accident-that-paralysed-him">Hanif Kureishi</a> arrived to also undergo rehabilitation. As well as being a successful novelist and screenwriter, Hanif directly inspired me to start these blogs. That’s because he has been dictating Substack posts via his partner and children since he suffered a debilitating spinal cord injury himself on Boxing Day last year. I was made aware of his regular “dispatches” while in Royal London hospital, and read all of them. It was helpful to hear what somebody else going through the same kind of experience as me was making of it, and it brought me solace when he wrote about struggling with some of the same things that I have. More generally it made me think that if he could write, then I should try writing too. And so I did.</p> <p>Hanif and I have had a couple of good conversations since he arrived, but nothing is ever easy in this new life and he is now mostly isolated for infection control reasons.</p> <h2><strong>3 December</strong></h2> <p>I’ve written before about how utterly overwhelming this experience is. Well it turns out that it doesn’t get easier with time. I didn’t realise one could be overwhelmed by constantly feeling overwhelmed. Overwhelm fatigue. Metawhelmed, if you like. That’s where I’m at right now. My mind is a cacophony of paradoxical, or at least incoherent, thoughts.</p> <p>Here’s an example. Last week was my “case conference”, when the therapists and medical leads here sat down with my parents and I to discuss my progress to date, and future steps. They congratulated me on having made real gains as a result of trying very hard in my various physio and therapy sessions, and therefore extending my admission by another month. This is only done for people who have made progress and whom it is believed will make further gains if they stay longer. By no means does everyone get extended.</p> <p>Great news for me, right? Of course I can see that this is ultimately positive. My parents were a little baffled, however, as to why I nonetheless apparently took so little cheer from it. The answer is that I find it hard to be uplifted by progress towards a goal that I fundamentally don’t want. The brute truth is that I don’t want to be a better-than-expected tetraplegic. I want to be an able-bodied man with his life back. And the fact this is impossible doesn’t stop me wanting it. </p> <h2><strong>26 January 2024</strong></h2> <p>If nothing else, the past half a year has made me acutely aware of how dependent on family one becomes even while living in the heart of the NHS. If it weren’t for my mother and father, I would be truly screwed. It would have been impossible for me to single-handedly deal with things like securing accommodation for the future, let alone communicating with my employer and various crucial organisations during the first few months of my injury. As far as I can tell, after an accident like mine, those who don’t have family to pick up the pieces are in the direst of dire&nbsp;straits.</p> <p>So I’m lucky to have parents who care enough, and are competent enough and financially stable enough, to offer me serious help in rebuilding something like a life. And for this, of course, I am grateful. Which leads to a question: why then do I sometimes behave like such a shit?</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>The most painful thing is sorting old clothes. Every item had a connection to my former life and put a dagger through my heart</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Last weekend was not my finest hour. Having made the long trek down from Merseyside to the rehab centre just outside Watford, my mum and dad came to spend time with me. And I rewarded them with toddler levels of truculence and incivility. Why can’t I behave nicely, as a fitting display of the gratitude that I do genuinely feel towards them?</p> <p>The answer I think lies, at least in part, in the fact that half a year ago I was an independent adult with his own income, career, projects, and so forth, but I am now effectively reduced to the status of a child. I need Mummy and Daddy to help me with everything in life. And this is a very difficult thing to come to terms with. And if one is now living like a baby, why not act like one?</p> <p>Add to that the fact that I’m now in the position of having to be grateful <em>all the time</em>: to the person that wipes my arse, to whoever washes me, or puts my clothes on or brushes my teeth. I am grateful to the person that brings my lunch out and puts it in front of me, to the nurse who puts my afternoon medication into my mouth. I am grateful to the staff in the gym that I spend most of the day with, most of whom by now have had to cope with either my piss or shit at least once. I am grateful to whichever persons put me to bed before propping up my iPad so that I can watch some crap on Netflix before falling asleep and repeating it all again.</p> <p>The result of this is what one might call gratitude exhaustion. </p> <h2><strong>5 February</strong></h2> <p>One of the many things that I never appreciated about my old life is that I was virtually never bored. My work consisted mostly of reading and discussing interesting ideas with colleagues and students. If I got bored during the day, I’d amuse myself by playing online chess (poorly). I trained for climbing 10 to 15 hours a week, while weekends were almost always spent driving somewhere it wasn’t raining so as to climb outdoors.</p> <p>Evenings after training left time for good-quality TV, or reading a novel. And of course there were always friends to catch up with in London if I ever felt like actually being sociable. Failing that, I’d go fishing. Essentially, if I was awake I was active, either in body or mind. A lazy weekend, doing nothing, was something like my idea of a bad time.</p> <p>The contrast with my new life could hardly be more stark. I now regularly spend chunks of time just doing nothing. </p> <p>The strangest thing, though, is how accustomed I have become to this mode of living. Seconds become minutes, become hours, become days. Time just drifts by unfilled, and I watch as it passes. I’m bored, but weirdly indifferent about that boredom. It doesn’t drive me crazy like it would have before. I’ve become somebody else; somebody I don’t especially admire, but who seems worryingly like they are here to stay.</p> <h2><strong>10 March</strong></h2> <p>I have now moved on to a nursing home. There is no doubt that it is an improvement on living behind a curtain in a hospital ward. Nonetheless, I have the sense of starring in my own personal <em>Groundhog</em> <em>Day</em>. Every day is basically the same. Mornings are lost, waiting for my various needs to be dealt with. Afternoons I spend trying to work, with decreasing levels of enthusiasm. Evenings I play some online chess, wondering how it is possible to get progressively worse as the days pass. Then it is back to bed for yet more TV. Rinse, repeat. I never go anywhere new. I have no plans. There are no holidays to look forward to. No weekends away. Just more of the same, day after day. Bill Murray, I get it now.</p> <p>And so it might not be especially surprising to hear that I am not doing very well psychologically. Leaving the hell of rehab, getting some minimal privacy, and being able to read serious work for the first time in months gave me an initial mental boost. But it is not especially surprising that this was not a magic cure. And yet I am still taken aback by the scale of my mental collapse. I feel as hopeless, as unable to accept and adapt, as at any other time since I regained consciousness. For a few weeks, I genuinely thought I was getting better. I do not feel even remotely close to that any more.</p>    <p>All of which has led me to a decision. I have begun the process of formally applying to Dignitas, with the eventual possibility of assisted suicide. Many more steps will be required if I am ultimately to go through with this, and I will have the option of changing my mind at many points in the future. (Some people have tried to tell me that I will not be eligible because I am not terminally ill, but I have done my research and although there is no guarantee that I will be accepted for consideration, tetraplegics from Britain have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/27/the-britons-who-made-their-final-journey-to-dignitas-clinic">used the Swiss service before</a>.) At the very least, what this gives me is the psychological comfort of knowing there is an escape route. I am so tired of feeling completely trapped, forced to stay alive by other people, with all the power and control removed from my own life. Even if I don’t take the option, knowing that the option is at least there provides a kind of comfort: the knowledge that I still have a final small amount of meaningful agency, that I can finally make this <em>stop</em> if I want to.</p> <h2><strong>11 May</strong></h2> <p>Last week I completed the long process of losing my home. The apartment I lived in for three years has changed hands, and now belongs to somebody else. And it hurts so much.</p> <p>The place was very modest; just a small one-bedroom flat. But it was <em>mine</em>. Those were my bookshelves. My choices of mountainscape on the wall. My arrangement of furniture. My base of operations for work, whenever I wasn’t travelling, trying to get as much time in the great outdoors as I could. Shortly before my accident, as a way of channelling the emotional pain from the breakup of a four-year relationship I had repainted most of the walls and doors, even had a new carpet fitted in the bedroom. And then one day I walked out and drove away, not knowing that it was for the last time. Nobody told me that I would never see the place again. I never got to say goodbye.</p> <h2><strong>5 June</strong></h2> <p>It has been a year to the day since my accident. A year since I woke up somewhere peaceful, somewhere quiet, at a time of my own choosing. Since it was up to me alone how long I stayed in bed. A year since I could piss standing up, of my own volition, rather than it dribbling out of me into a plastic bag. A year since I made my own breakfast. Since I was able to lift a normal cup of coffee. A year since I was able to drive, often hundreds of miles at a time, just to be outdoors and in the wild.</p> <p>Far more than a year since I held a woman’s hand, felt the touch of a human body against mine. But a year since these things were even possible for me; something that could sanely be hoped for some future day. A year since it was physically possible for me to enjoy exercise, or use it as a weapon against the parasite of depression that now resides in regal ascendancy over my mind. A year since I climbed. That indescribable world of adventure, which gave my life satisfaction and meaning. The antidote to the psychological ill-health that an academic career made me otherwise so especially vulnerable to.</p> <p>A year since I woke up even just indifferent about, let alone looking forward to, the day ahead. A year since my first thought hasn’t been wishing that I had died in the night. A year since I felt more than fleeting moments of happiness. A year since I felt joy.</p> <p>A year since I died.</p> <p>A year since I was reborn into a life I never agreed to, and would never have chosen, but am condemned by others to continue. A lot can change in a year. And so perhaps, out of the darkness, comes also the light of hope.</p> <h2><strong>18 June</strong></h2> <p>Through the herculean efforts of my parents, I now have a new place to call my own. And making the adjustment has been perhaps the most difficult thing I have been through so far.</p> <p>I really didn’t think it would be this way. While nervous, before the date of the move I experienced a definite uptick in mood. This began to fade once we pulled on to the North Circular. Here was a route I had driven many times in my old life. The store where I bought furniture for my first apartment. The pet shop where I sometimes got supplies for the cats (that I no longer have). The turning I used to take to the Lea Valley to fish for pike in the winter. When I last saw these places, I was driving my own van. Now I was in the back of an ambulance, being awkwardly jolted around. Memories came flooding back punching me in the gut, reminding me how much I have lost.</p> <p>My mum came down to meet the ambulance crew and help transfer me and my possessions up into the new flat.</p> <p>One thing stopping this apartment from feeling like a home is that the walls are all bare. The answer to which would normally be obvious and easy: hang up my own pictures. But there’s the rub. Hanging any of my old artwork on the walls is almost too painful to contemplate, not least because a lot of it consists of framed pictures of mountains. Mountains <em>that</em> <em>I</em> <em>have</em> <em>climbed</em>. Even non-climbing artwork inevitably comes with memories of previous homes it has hung in; past times in my past life; friends in happier years.</p> <p>But pictures were by no means the worst of it. Also transported from my old home to my new were my old clothes. The problem is that now I can’t wear most of them. All of my old jeans, and anything with a button or a buckle, now poses the threat of pressure sores. When it comes to upper layers, anything snug against my former physique is now impossible to combine with the repulsive potbelly I permanently sport. So I agreed to help my mum triage my old clothes, deciding what to keep and what to throw away.</p> <p>I don’t think I’m exaggerating when I say this is the most painful thing I’ve ever had to do. Virtually every piece of clothing had some connection to my former life: climbing gear, bouldering gym merch, T-shirts from climbing destinations, outdoor brands – aside from the odd Guns N’ Roses T-shirt, almost every item put a dagger through my heart. Or rather, two daggers. One for myself, who died. One for climbing, the love I lost.</p> <h2><strong>7 August</strong></h2> <p>It’s been a while, and enough people have been in contact in various ways, asking if I’m all right, that I feel a quick update is in order. In the grand scheme of things, yes. On the physical side, putting aside for now that my body is a wreckage site that will only get worse with time, I’m doing OK. No further complications, with UTIs and spasms under control, for once.</p> <p>On the mental side, well… it’s a process. My occupational therapist in rehab told me that most people find the first three to six months after leaving hospital the hardest. My physical therapist said I should expect the first year to be “hell”. So far, I can’t argue with that. I’ve been able to distract myself with academic research and writing, which is certainly more than nothing. But it’s hard to feel like it’s enough.</p>    <h2><strong>25 October</strong></h2> <p>I have been watching the debate over changing the UK’s law on assisted dying with sardonic interest. On the face of it the debate should have nothing to do with me. I, after all, am not terminally ill, and what is being debated is whether people with six months or less to live should be able to die by suicide with medical help. I simply don’t meet the criteria. However, those who oppose a change in the law often claim that if the law is loosened, we will be on a slippery slope down to a place where <em>people</em> <em>like</em> <em>me </em>(disabled people) are not only offered assisted suicide, but pressed by wider society into taking that option. And as this would be bad, the law should stay as it is. On the other side, those who favour changing the law vigorously deny (at least in public) that any such slippery slope will be encountered – and thus they implicitly or explicitly agree that assisted suicide should only be for those who, to put it bluntly, are going to die soon anyway. Hence, again, it is <em>not</em> <em>for me. </em>The effect of which is to compound my overwhelming sense that I am trapped in a living nightmare from which I cannot escape.</p> <p>When medical professionals decided that my ruined body should live, whether I might have wanted it to or not, they also determined that any future choice about whether to continue would for ever be taken away from me. Whereas a normal-bodied (or even just less disabled) person could take matters into their own hands and decide that enough is enough, I cannot. I need the help of someone else. And the law is pretty clear that nobody is allowed to help me. Hence, trapped. The potential loophole here is of course to go abroad, to a jurisdiction where medically assisted suicide is legal. And so, I’m working on it. The application to Dignitas is active.</p> <h2><strong>11 November</strong></h2> <p>In ancient Greek mythology, Pandora is said to have unleashed a range of curses upon humankind. Curiosity led her to open a box entrusted to her husband, out of which death, sickness and a host of other evils escaped. But left behind, so the story goes, was hope.</p> <p>One way to read this is as a sort of consolation. That despite all the evils humanity is forced to endure, we are able to cling to the light of hope. But I’ve long suspected (both before my accident, and especially since) that hope is the worst curse of them all.</p> <p>Moral philosophers like Adam Smith would rightly point out that being in a wheelchair, with virtually useless hands, is not a permanent obstacle to mental tranquillity. Plenty of happy tetraplegics prove it to be so (and indeed, I have met some of them). If I first <em>accept</em> my situation, and allow my psychology to adjust to it, it should be possible to escape the pit of despair.</p> <p>But I am consumed by a hope that holds me back. This comes in the form of longing for medical and technological advances that somehow “cure” spinal cord injury. This is indulged by regular Google searches along those lines. Like the other night, when I went down the rabbit hole of investigating NVG-291, the leading candidate for a therapeutic treatment, now in <a href="https://nervgen.com/cto/">phase 1b/2a human trials</a>. Riding the high of hope, I convince myself that I’m only going to have to do this for a few years, and then I’m going to get my life back. But then the hope wears off, and reality hits: that even if it lives up to the most optimistic hopes, NVG-291 is only going to restore partial functions, and will anyway take years to arrive in a clinically administered setting. And even if it does arrive, I am not getting my old life back, because that life is now definitively over.</p> <p>As the saying goes, it’s the hope that kills you. My hope is a curse. I need it to die. I need to accept.</p> <p>Maybe tomorrow.</p> <ul> <li><p>Read Paul Sagar’s Substack, Diary of a Punter, <a href="https://diaryofapunter.substack.com/">here</a></p></li> </ul>'

                        content: '<p>Anthony Albanese says Kevin Rudd will remain as Australia’s ambassador to Washington despite the apparent disquiet about Rudd’s past commentary on president-elect Donald Trump among some in Trump’s inner circle.</p> <p>Albanese is digging in against media speculation that Trump could demand Rudd’s withdrawal or that others in his administration could make the ambassador’s position untenable, insisting he will stay in the job no matter what.</p> <p>“That’s what we’d expect,” he told ABC’s Insiders program on Sunday.</p> <p>“He’s Australia’s appointment,” Albanese said, speaking from the Apec summit in Peru. “And it says something about the importance of the United States that we have appointed a former prime minister. That’s a sign of how seriously we take this relationship, which is a relationship between our peoples based upon our common values.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/15/former-ambassador-to-washington-accuses-sky-news-australia-of-personal-and-political-campaign-against-kevin-rudd-ntwnfb">Former ambassador to US accuses unnamed Sky News Australia presenters of campaign against Kevin Rudd</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Albanese declined to say whether Rudd should apologise for past remarks, which included social media posts calling him “the most destructive president in history” and a 2021 interview in which he described Trump in a 2021 interview as “the village idiot” and “not a leading intellectual force”.</p> <p>“We’re focused on the future, and I’m sure President Trump will be as well, and that is the important thing,” Albanese said.</p> <p>The emergence last week of video of the 2021 remarks this week coincided with a social media post from Trump’s now newly appointed deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino depicting sand running through an hourglass, above a screenshot of the congratulatory message Rudd had issued about Trump’s election win.</p> <p>But Albanese said Rudd has been doing “a terrific job” and will continue in the role.</p> <p>He praised the former prime minister’s work building bipartisan relationships and boosting Australia’s ties in the US capital.</p> <p>“Ambassador, Rudd has been working with people across the political spectrum. He attended both the Republican and the Democrat national conventions and engaged with people across the board. I know that he was in regular contact with the head of the Republican campaign committee as well, as well as the Democrats.”</p> <p>In a separate interview with Sky News, also from Peru, Albanese said his 10-minute congratulatory phone conversation with Trump had been “very constructive and positive” and Rudd was not mentioned.</p> <p>“He’s Australia’s ambassador to Washington, and he’s doing a very important job,” Albanese said. “The work that he did with Aukus was a difficult task to get that through the Congress and the Senate. But when I was there, one of the things that struck me was just how extensive the links that Kevin Rudd had developed at the US, Congress and the Senate were.”</p>'
